# Customization

Customization of DateRangePicker will be easier with its flexible customization options.

## Setting Dimension

Height and width of the DateRangePicker can be changed using corresponding API (**Height**,**Width**) like below code examples.


Add the following code in your CSHTML page to render DateRangePicker with customized **Height** and **Width**.

   
   ~~~ cshtml

     @*Add the following code example to the corresponding CSHTML page to render DateRangePicker widget with customized height and width*@
        
     @Html.EJ().DateRangePicker("DateRange").Height("50").Width("300")
    
   ~~~  

## Rounded Corners

**ShowRoundedCorner** property is used to add rounded borders to the input and popup elements. By default, ShowRoundedCorners property will be disabled state. we can enable the property by setting **ShowRoundedCorner** as **true**.

Add the following code in your CSHTML page to render DateRangePicker widget with rounded corners.

   ~~~ cshtml
   
  	 @*Add the following code example to the corresponding CSHTML page to render DateRangePicker widget with rounded corners*@

	 @Html.EJ().DateRangePicker("DateRange").ShowRoundedCorner(true)

   ~~~


## Persistence

The value of DateRangePicker can be sustained even after form post back and page refreshing by enabling the **EnablePersistence** API like below code example.

   ~~~ cshtml
    
     @*Add the following code example to the corresponding CSHTML page to enable state persistence in rendered DateRangePicker widget*@

     @Html.EJ().DateRangePicker("DateRange").EnablePersistence(true)

   ~~~

The DateRangePicker Model value will be stored in local storage / cookies of browser before page refreshes and reinitialized with the restored model after refresh.


## Preset Ranges

We can make use of **Ranges** API for easy selection of preset ranges from the popup. Each preset range will have a label which will be displayed on the right side of the popup with user-defined name. By clicking the labels the associated date ranges will get updated in the popup, automatically.
   
   ~~~ cshtml

     @*Add the following code example to the corresponding CSHTML page to enable state persistence in DateRangePicker widget*@

     @{List<Object> lastWeek = new List<Object>() { DateTime.Today.AddDays(-7),DateTime.Today.AddDays(-1)};}
     @{List<Object> lastMonth = new List<Object>() { DateTime.Today.AddMonths(-1), DateTime.Today.AddDays(-1) };}
     @{List<Object> lastYear = new List<Object>() { DateTime.Today.AddYears(-1), DateTime.Today.AddDays(-1) };}
     @{List<Object> special = new List<Object>() { "12/25/2017", "1/1/2018" };}

     @Html.EJ().DateRangePicker("DateRange").Value("05/28/2016-06/27/2017").Ranges(e => e.Add().Label("Last Week").Range(lastWeek)).Ranges(p => p.Add().Label("Last Month").Range(lastMonth)).Ranges(m=>m.Add().Label("Last Year").Range(lastYear)).Ranges(n => n.Add().Label("Special Week").Range(special)).Width("60%")

    ~~~
