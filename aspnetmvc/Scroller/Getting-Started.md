# Getting Started

This section explains briefly about how to create a Scroller in your ASP.NET MVC application.

## Create your first Scroller in MVC

ASP.NET MVCScroller control allows you to slide document whose position corresponds to a value. The document has text, HTML content or images. Refer the following guidelines to create a Scroller control for horizontal and vertical Scrolling.

### Add Scroller Control to your MVC Application

Essential Studio ASP.NET MVC Scroller control has a built-in feature to customize the resizing and changing the Scrollbar theme.

1. Create an MVC Project and add required assemblies, scripts, and styles to it. Refer [MVC-Getting Started](https://help.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/getting-started) Documentation.
2. Add the following code example to the corresponding view page to render the Scroller. 

   ~~~ cshtml

	<div id="scrollContent">

		<div> @* Wrapper div for Scroller.*@

			<div class="inner-content"> @* Content div*@

				<h3> MVC </h3>

				<p>

					Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architecture pattern which   

					separates the representation of information from the user's interaction 

					with it. The model consists of application data, business rules, logic, and 

					functions. A view can be any output representation of data, such as a chart 

					or a diagram. 

				</p>

			</div>

		</div>

	</div>  

	@{ Html.EJ().Scroller("scrollContent").Height(150).Width(300).Render(); }

   ~~~
   
   
3. Add the following style in the view page to set the height and width of the Scroller.

   ~~~ css

	<style type="text/css" class="cssStyles">

		.inner-content
		{

		width: 400px;

		padding:15px;

		}

	</style>
		
   ~~~
   

4. Execute the above example code to get the following output.
