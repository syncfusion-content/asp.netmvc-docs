# Multiple Targets

The SpellCheck control has support for multiple target HTML element's texts spelling and correct its error words. This can be achieved by passing the target HTML elements “id” values to the property “ControlsToValidate”.

You can spell check most of the HTML element’s texts such as div, span, textarea, input, address and article by using this property.

The multiple target HTML element supports in both the modes.

 * Dialog Mode
 * Context Menu Mode
 
The following code example describes the above behavior.

        London, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world for a reason. A cultural and historical hub, London has an excellent public transportation system that allows visitors to see all the fantastic sights without spending a ton of money on a rental car.
        London contains four World Heritage Sites.
    </div><br />
    <textarea id="control2" style="width:940px">
        Paris, the city of lights and love - this short guide is full of ideas for how to make the most of the romanticism that oozes from every one of its beautiful corners.You couldn't possibly visit Rome, one of the world's most fascinating cities. The old adage that Rome was not built in a day - and that you won't see it in one or even in three - is true. For the intrepid traveler who can keep pace, here is a list of must-sees.
        But remember what the Romans say: Even a lifetime isn't enough to see Rome.

    <span id="control3">
        Rome, one of the world's most fascinating cities. The old adage that Rome was not built in a day - and that you won't see it in one or even in three - is true. For the intrepid traveler who can keep pace, here is a list of must-sees.

    @Html.EJ().SpellCheck("TextArea").ControlsToValidate("control1,control2,control3").DictionarySettings(dictionary => dictionary.CustomDictionaryUrl("../api/SpellCheck/AddToDictionary").DictionaryUrl("../api/SpellCheck/CheckWords"))
 
    @Html.EJ().Button("SpellCheck").Text("Spell check using dialog").ClientSideEvents(event => event.Click("showDialog"))
  }

{% endhighlight %}

N> You need to pass the target HTML element's id value with the comma separator. For example, in the above code example passed id values of div(control1), textarea(control2) and span(control3) element.

## Dialog Mode

If the user specifies multiple targets in ControlsToValidate property, the control must loop through the multiple HTML target elements one by one in the order which they are specified and process of every individual target’ content.
