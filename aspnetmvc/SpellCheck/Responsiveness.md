{% highlight CSHTML %}

@section ControlsSection{<div id="TextArea" contenteditable="true" name="sentence">
    Facebook is a social networking service headquartered in Menlo Park, California. Its website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg with his Harvard College roommates and fellow students Eduardo, Andrew McCollum, Dustin and Chris Hughes.
    The founders had initially limited the websites membership to Harvard students, but later expanded it to collages in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities and later to high-school students.
</div><br />
 
   @Html.EJ().("TextArea").SpellCheck("TextArea").IsResponsive(true).DictionarySettings(dictionary => dictionary.CustomDictionaryUrl("../api/SpellCheck/AddToDictionary").DictionaryUrl("../api/SpellCheck/CheckWords"))
 
}

{% endhighlight %}
