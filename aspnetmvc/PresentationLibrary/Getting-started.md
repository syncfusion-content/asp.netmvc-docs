# Getting started

This section provides explains you the basic information on how to get started with creating or editing Microsoft PowerPoint files with few lines of code by using Essential Presentation APIs.

## Creating a new Presentation from scratch with basic elements

An entire PowerPoint file is represented with an instance of IPresentation interface of Essential Presentation. IPresentation is the root element in Essential Presentation DOM (document object model). Each Presentation consists of collection of slides. By Uusing this DOM, you can add, edit and remove content from the document by iterating elements.

In this section, we will seeyou can learn how to create a simple PowerPoint presentation with few slides in few lines by using Essential Presentation API.

Initially, we will seeyou can learn how to create a slide as follows.like the one below.

![](Getting-started_images/Getting-started_img1.png)



Create an instance of IPresentationinterface as shown belowfollows. Instance of IPresentation represents the root element of Presentation which that in turn contains the collections of slides.

{% highlight c# %}

//Creates a new instance of PowerPoint Presentation

IPresentation presentation = Presentation.Create();

{% endhighlight %}

Presentation has a property named “Slides” to represent the slide collections. Create an instance of an ISlide in the presentation though by using the Add method of slide collection, and during the creation of slide, the useryou can specify the layout design as parameter. 

{% highlight c# %}

//presentation.Slides represents the collection of slides in PowerPoint presentation

//Add a slide into the presentation through the Add method of Slide collection property

//The user has to pass the Slide design type as parameter

ISlide firstSlide = presentation.Slides.Add(SlideLayoutType.Blank);

{% endhighlight %}

Each slide contains a collection of shapes. All the contents are added in slide as a shape or within a shape. The userYou can add the textual contents in a slide with the help of textbox shape. The below following code example explains how to adds a textbox within the slide. The userYou need to specify the left position, top position, width & height (in points) as parameters. 

{% highlight c# %}

//Add a textbox shape in a slide by specifying its position & size

IShape titleShape = firstSlide.AddTextBox(100, 75, 756, 200);

//set the vertical alignment of textual contents within textbox shape

titleShape.TextBody.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignmentType.Bottom;

{% endhighlight %}

All the contents of textbox or shape have to beis added with in its body which that is represents a property named “TextBody”. Then add a paragraph into the textbox shape as shown belowfollows. Here, Tthe horizontal alignment of paragraph has beenis set to center here., bBy default it is left aligned.

{% highlight c# %}

//Add a paragraph in the body of the shape

IParagraph paragraph = titleShape.TextBody.AddParagraph();

//set the Horizontal alignment of the paragraph as center

paragraph.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignmentType.Center;

{% endhighlight %}

A paragraph can contain more than one text part. TextPart holds textual contents in the paragraph and is simply like span tag in html. Here, we havetext part is added a text part with the text ““Hello Presentation” and set its formatting such as bold and font size.

{% highlight c# %}

//Add a textPart in the paragraph

ITextPart textPart = paragraph.AddTextPart("Hello Presentation");

textPart.Font.FontSize = 80;

textPart.Font.Bold = true;

{% endhighlight %}

At this point, the slide created will look like the below one.Refer to the following scrennshot.

![](Getting-started_images/Getting-started_img2.png)





Now, we are going to add another textbox shape in the shape. Further, within the textbox shape, we will be adding two paragraphs as follows.



{% highlight c# %}

//Add another textbox shape 

IShape subTitleShape = firstSlide.AddTextBox(100, 300, 756, 100);

//Set the vertical alignment of textbox shape as top

subTitleShape.TextBody.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignmentType.Top;

//Add the first paragraph in the textbox shape

paragraph = subTitleShape.TextBody.AddParagraph();

//set the horizontal alignment of the paragraph as center

paragraph.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignmentType.Center;

//Add a new text part in the first paragraph with the text “by”

textPart = paragraph.AddTextPart("by");

//Sets the font size of the textpart as 40

textPart.Font.FontSize = 40;

//Add the second paragraph in the textbox shape

paragraph = subTitleShape.TextBody.AddParagraph();

paragraph.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignmentType.Center;

//Add a new text part in the second paragraph with the text “James Smith”

textPart = paragraph.AddTextPart("James Smith");

textPart.Font.FontSize = 40;

{% endhighlight %}

On saving the Presentation at this instance will result with the PowerPoint Presentation with one slide and its contents are like belowfollows. We have completed our first slide in the PowerPoint Presentation.

![](Getting-started_images/Getting-started_img3.png)



Now we are going tothis section demonstrates how to create a bulleted and numbered list in our the second slide as follows.. we will see how to create a slide like the one below 

![](Getting-started_images/Getting-started_img4.png)


In order to create this slide, the user have to add three textbox shape in the slide. A textbox shape to hold the title “Bulleted & Numbered List”, a textbox to hold the bulleted list in the left side of the slide and another textbox to hold the numbered list in the right side.

Now, we will start creating the second slide of our presentation. The below following code example explains how to adds a new slide into the PowerPoint presentation.

{% highlight c# %}

//Add the second slide into the presentation 

ISlide secondSlide = presentation.Slides.Add(SlideLayoutType.Blank);



Add a new textbox at the top of the slide in order to set the title content for the slide. Further add a new paragraph within the newly created shape and add a text part with the text “Bulleted & Numbered List” as like belowfollows.

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c# %}

//Add the textbox to add title of the slide

titleShape = secondSlide.AddTextBox(65, 30, 830, 100);

//sets the vertical alignment of shape contents as middle

titleShape.TextBody.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignmentType.Middle;

//Add a new paragraph into the shape

paragraph = titleShape.TextBody.AddParagraph();

//set the horizontal alignment of the paragraph

paragraph.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignmentType.Center;

//Add a textpart as child to the paragraph and set its text as “Bulleted & Numbered //List”

textPart = paragraph.AddTextPart("Bulleted & Numbered List");

//Sets the font name & font size of the textpart

textPart.Font.FontSize = 72;

textPart.Font.FontName = "Calibri";

{% endhighlight %}

After setting the title content of the slide, then create two textboxes, one at the left hand side and other at the right hand side of the slide.

{% highlight c# %}

// adding a textbox to hold the bulleted list 

IShape leftShape = secondSlide.AddTextBox(65, 140, 410, 250);

// adding another textbox to hold the numbered list

IShape rightShape = secondSlide.AddTextBox(485, 140, 410, 250);

{% endhighlight %}

The In order to add a list into the slide, initially we have to be familiar about its important properties.

ListFormat property of the paragraph represents all the list information. Some of the important properties are explained belowin the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>
Property Name</th><th>
Short Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Type</td><td>
Specifies the type of the list. The value Ccan be None or Bulleted or Numbered.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
IndentLevelNumber</td><td>
Specifies the list level of the paragraph. The Ppossible value range can beis 1 to 9.On changing the value of IndentLevelNumber, the useryou can easily create nested list level easily.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
BulletCharacter</td><td>
Represents the bullet character. The user has toYou can set the bullet character manually while when creating the list.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
FontName</td><td>
Represents the font name of the bullet character.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Size</td><td>
Represents the size of the bullet or number with respect to its paragraph text size. Its unit is Percentage. Here, ifwhen the user you set the Size as 200%, the bullet character or number size will beis 200% of its text. The Ppossible range can be 25 to 400</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
NumberStyle</td><td>
Specifies the numbering style of the list. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Startvalue</td><td>
Specifies the starting value of the numbered list. By default, it starts from 1</td></tr>
</table>


Initially, we shall see about creating a bulleted list. Here, a new paragraph is addinged a new paragraph and accessed itsthe ListFormat property is accessed. In order to create a bulleted list, the user has toyou can set the list type as bulleted (paragraph.ListFormat.Type = ListType.Bulleted;) and set its list level by  using the property IndentLevelNumber as 1. Then set its bullet character, font name & size as shown belowfollows. 



Finally set the hanging indent of the paragraph with the property “FirstLineIndent”. There is no separate property for hanging indent and first line indent. If the value is positive, then the first line indent will beis applied, if the value is in negative, then the hanging indent will beis applied.



{% highlight c# %}


// adding a new paragraph with the text in the left hand side textbox. 

paragraph = leftShape.TextBody.AddParagraph("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.");

//Set the list type as bulleted

paragraph.ListFormat.Type = ListType.Bulleted;

//setting the bullet character for this list paragraph

paragraph.ListFormat.BulletCharacter = Convert.ToChar(183);

// setting the font of the bullet character

paragraph.ListFormat.FontName = "Symbol";

// setting the bullet character size. If 100, here means 100% of its text. Possible values can range from 25 to 400

paragraph.ListFormat.Size = 100;

// setting the list level as 1. Possible values can range from 1 to 9

paragraph.IndentLevelNumber = 1;

// setting the hanging value as 20

paragraph.FirstLineIndent = -20;

{% endhighlight %}

Like the above one, nNow we areyou can createing a new paragraph with bulleted list and set its list level as 2 by using the property “IndentLevelNumber” as shown belowfollows.

{% highlight c# %}

// adding another paragraph with the text in the left hand side textbox.  

paragraph = leftShape.TextBody.AddParagraph("Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.");

//Set the list type as bulleted

paragraph.ListFormat.Type = ListType.Bulleted;

//setting the bullet character for this list paragraph

paragraph.ListFormat.BulletCharacter = Convert.ToChar(183);

// setting the font of the bullet character

paragraph.ListFormat.FontName = "Symbol";

// setting the bullet character size. If 100, here means 100% of its text. Possible values can range from 25 to 400

paragraph.ListFormat.Size = 100;

// setting the list level as 2. Possible values can range from 1 to 9

paragraph.IndentLevelNumber = 2;

// setting the hanging value as 20

paragraph.FirstLineIndent = -20;

{% endhighlight %}


Now, at this instance the slide will look like the below.Refer to the following screenshot.



![](Getting-started_images/Getting-started_img5.png)





Further, we areHere, adding two new paragraph with the bulleted list. One with list level as 2 and other one with list level as 1.



{% highlight c# %}

// adding another paragraph with the text in the left hand side textbox.  

paragraph = leftShape.TextBody.AddParagraph("Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.");

//Set the list type as bulleted

paragraph.ListFormat.Type = ListType.Bulleted;

//setting the bullet character for this list paragraph

paragraph.ListFormat.BulletCharacter = Convert.ToChar(183);

// setting the font of the bullet character

paragraph.ListFormat.FontName = "Symbol";

// setting the bullet character size. If 100, here means 100% of its text. Possible values can range from 25 to 400

paragraph.ListFormat.Size = 100;

// setting the list level as 2. Possible values can range from 1 to 9

paragraph.IndentLevelNumber = 2;

// setting the hanging value as 20

paragraph.FirstLineIndent = -20;

paragraph = leftShape.TextBody.AddParagraph("Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.");

//Set the list type as bulleted

paragraph.ListFormat.Type = ListType.Bulleted;

//setting the bullet character for this list paragraph

paragraph.ListFormat.BulletCharacter = Convert.ToChar(183);

// setting the font of the bullet character

paragraph.ListFormat.FontName = "Symbol";

// setting the bullet character size. If 100, here means 100% of its text. Possible values can range from 25 to 400

paragraph.ListFormat.Size = 100;

// setting the list level as 1. Possible values can range from 1 to 9

paragraph.IndentLevelNumber = 1;

// setting the hanging value as 20

paragraph.FirstLineIndent = -20;

{% endhighlight %}

On saving the presentation at this instance, the second slide with the list will look like the belowis as follows.


![](Getting-started_images/Getting-started_img6.png)


Now we are going to seeThis section explains how to create numbered list. 



{% highlight c# %}


paragraph = rightShape.TextBody.AddParagraph("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.");

//setting the list type as Numbered list

paragraph.ListFormat.Type = ListType.Numbered;

//setting the numbered style (list numbering) as Arabic number following by period.

paragraph.ListFormat.NumberStyle = NumberedListStyle.ArabicPeriod;

//setting the starting value as 1

paragraph.ListFormat.StartValue = 1;

// setting the list level as 1

paragraph.IndentLevelNumber = 1;

// setting the hanging value as 20

paragraph.FirstLineIndent = -20;


{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight c# %}

paragraph = rightShape.TextBody.AddParagraph("Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.");

//setting the list type as Numbered list

paragraph.ListFormat.Type = ListType.Numbered;

//setting the numbered style (list numbering) as lower case alphabet following by period.

paragraph.ListFormat.NumberStyle = NumberedListStyle.AlphaLcPeriod;

// setting the list level as 2

paragraph.IndentLevelNumber = 2;

// setting the hanging value as 20

paragraph.FirstLineIndent = -20;



paragraph = rightShape.TextBody.AddParagraph("Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.");

//setting the list type as Numbered list

paragraph.ListFormat.Type = ListType.Numbered;

//setting the numbered style (list numbering) as roman number lower casing following by period.

paragraph.ListFormat.NumberStyle = NumberedListStyle.RomanLcPeriod;

// setting the list level as 3

paragraph.IndentLevelNumber = 3;

// setting the hanging value as 20

paragraph.FirstLineIndent = -20;



paragraph = rightShape.TextBody.AddParagraph("Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.");

//setting the list type as Numbered list

paragraph.ListFormat.Type = ListType.Numbered;

paragraph.ListFormat.NumberStyle = NumberedListStyle.ArabicPeriod;

// setting the list level as 1

paragraph.IndentLevelNumber = 1;

// setting the hanging value as 20

paragraph.FirstLineIndent = -20;

{% endhighlight %}

On saving the presentation at this instance, then thisthe slide will looks like the below following screenshotone.

![](Getting-started_images/Getting-started_img7.png)





Now we are going to seeThis section explains how to insert a picture into a slide. Create a new slide with the title of “Inserting Image…”

{% highlight c# %}

//Add the third slide into the presentation 

ISlide thirdSlide = presentation.Slides.Add(SlideLayoutType.Blank);

//Add a textbox and set its vertical alignment as middle

titleShape = thirdSlide.AddTextBox(65, 30, 830, 100);

titleShape.TextBody.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignmentType.Middle;

//add a new paragraph in the titleShape and set its horizontal alignment as center

paragraph = titleShape.TextBody.AddParagraph();

paragraph.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignmentType.Center;

//Add a new text part with the text as “Inserting Image…”

textPart = paragraph.AddTextPart("Inserting Image...");

textPart.Font.FontSize = 72;

textPart.Font.FontName = "Calibri";

{% endhighlight %}

Image can be added into the slide with the help of AddPicture  methodAddPicture method of shape collection. While When the image is addeding the image, you can the user has to specify the image stream, position & size as parameters to this method. The below following code snippet example explains how to insert two images into the third slide.

{% highlight c# %}

//Add the third slide into the presentation 

Image image = Image.FromFile(@"image1.jpg");

IPicture picture = thirdSlide.Shapes.AddPicture(new MemoryStream(image.ImageData), 65, 140, 410, 250);



image = Image.FromFile(@"image2.jpg");

picture = thirdSlide.Shapes.AddPicture(new MemoryStream(image.ImageData), 485, 140, 410, 250);

{% endhighlight %}

After adding the images into the slide, now the slide will looks like the belowfollowing screenshot. 

![](Getting-started_images/Getting-started_img8.png)





Finally, you can save the presentation with the help ofby using Save method as shown belowfollows. In order to release the resources utilized by presentation instance, please make sure that the presentation gets closed finally.

{% highlight c# %}

//Add the third slide into the presentation 

presentation.Save("sample.pptx");

presentation.Close();

{% endhighlight %}

## Creating a Chart in Presentation from scratch 

Charts can convey much more than numbers and makes it easier to see understand the meaning behind the numbers. A Slide can have more than 1 chart. The userYou can access the chart present in the slide through the property ISlide.Charts which that represents the collection of chart in the slide. The chart collection provides a method named “AddChart” to include a chart in the slide. Basically, i In order to create a chart, the useryou need the data to be represents as chart, serie and& category information. The chart data is preserved within Presentation as an excel file (embedded). So fFilling the chart data values will beis like filling an excel sheet.

First up all, cCreate a new presentation with one slide as shown belowfollows.

{% highlight c# %}

//Create an instance of the IPresentation  

IPresentation presentation = Presentation.Create();

//Create a new slide

ISlide slide = presentation.Slides.Add(SlideLayoutType.Blank);

{% endhighlight %}

The chart has beenis represented by IOfficeChart interface in the Essential Presentation. Now, in the next step we are going to add a new chart into the slide.

{% highlight c# %}

//Add a new chart in the slide by specifying its position & size as parameters.

IOfficeChart chart = slide.Charts.AddChart(100, 150, 800, 350);

{% endhighlight %}

Chart title &and its formatting can beis set with the help ofby using ChartTitle property of IOfficeChart &and ChartTitleArea property of IOfficeChart respectively. 

{% highlight c# %}

//Add a new chart in the slide by specifying its position & size as parameters.

chart.ChartTitle = "Sales comparison";

chart.ChartTitleArea.Bold = true;

{% endhighlight %}

The chart type can beis specified with the help of ChartType property of IOfficeChart interface. 



> Note: 3D charts are not supported in image & PDF conversion.



{% highlight c# %}

//Specify the chart type 

chart.ChartType = OfficeExcelChartType.Column_Clustered;

{% endhighlight %}

All the chart data is preserved in the PowerPoint presentation, as an embedded excel sheet. So tThe data has to beis filled by having an excel sheet in mind. The chart data can beis added into the presentation by using with the help of ChartData property of IOfficeChart. This ChartData provides APIs for setting the value. 

{% highlight c# %}

//SetValue method takes 3 parameters – RowIndex, columnIndex & data

chart.ChartData.SetValue(1, 1, "Month");

chart.ChartData.SetValue(2, 1, "July");

chart.ChartData.SetValue(3, 1, "August");

chart.ChartData.SetValue(4, 1, "September");

chart.ChartData.SetValue(5, 1, "October");

chart.ChartData.SetValue(6, 1, "November");

chart.ChartData.SetValue(7, 1, "December");



chart.ChartData.SetValue(1, 2, "2013");

chart.ChartData.SetValue(2, 2, 35);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(3, 2, 37);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(4, 2, 30);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(5, 2, 29);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(6, 2, 25);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(7, 2, 30);



chart.ChartData.SetValue(1, 3, "2014");

chart.ChartData.SetValue(2, 3, 30);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(3, 3, 25);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(4, 3, 29);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(5, 3, 35);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(6, 3, 38);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(7, 3, 32);



chart.ChartData.SetValue(1, 4, "2015");

chart.ChartData.SetValue(2, 4, 35);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(3, 4, 37);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(4, 4, 30);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(5, 4, 29);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(6, 4, 25);

chart.ChartData.SetValue(7, 4, 30);

{% endhighlight %}

After the filling these data, the embedded excel sheet will looks like the belowfollowing screenshot. 

![](Getting-started_images/Getting-started_img10.png)



Once the chart data has beenis added, the useryou need to specify the Chart serie and& category for chart creation. IOfficeChartSerie interface represents the chart serie and Collection of chart serie that iscan be  accessed with the helpby of the Series property of IOfficeChart interface. The following code snippet example creates three series and set its data range.

{% highlight c# %}

//Create a new chart serie with the name “2013”

IOfficeChartSerie serie2013 = chart.Series.Add("2013");

//setting the data range of chart serie 

//This indexer takes 4 parameters – start row, start column, end row, end column

Serie2013.DataRange Values = chart.ChartData[2, 2, 7, 2];





IOfficeChartSerie serie2014 = chart.Series.Add("2014");

Serie2014.DataRange Values = chart.ChartData[2, 3, 7, 3];



IOfficeChartSerie serie2015 = chart.Series.Add("2015");

Serie2015.DataRange Values = chart.ChartData[2, 4, 7, 4];

{% endhighlight %}

Then set the primary category axis’s data range as shown belowfollows.

{% highlight c# %}

//setting the data range of the category axis

chart.PrimaryCategoryAxis.DataRange CategoryLabels = chart.ChartData[2, 1, 7, 1];

{% endhighlight %}

Finally, save the presentation with the help ofby using the Save method as shown belowfollows. In order to release the resources utilized by presentation instance, please make sure that the presentation get is closed finally.

{% highlight c# %}

//Add the third slide into the presentation 

presentation.Save("sample.pptx");

presentation.Close();

{% endhighlight %}

Now the chart added in the slide will looks like chart in the below following chartscreenshot.
