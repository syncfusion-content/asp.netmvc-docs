# Date Range

Date Range between two dates is achieved by MinDateTime, MaxDateTime property of DateTimePicker.

In DateTimePicker, a property called EnableStrictMode is available.When this property is set to false, it does not allow wrong values and corrects the entered value automatically. If it is true, then DateTimePicker allows values with error class to indicate the selected date is wrong.

MinDateTime - Sets the minimum value to the DateTimePicker. Based on the EnableStrictMode value behind the minimum value an error class is added to the wrapper element or it is corrected automatically to the nearest correct date value.

MaxDateTime - Sets the maximum value to the DateTimePicker. Based on the EnableStrictMode value beyond the maximum value an error class is added to the wrapper element or it is corrected automatically to the nearest correct date value.

Sometimes, you can give restrictions on selecting the date before or after the particular date. Consider you are going to make a project for hotel reservation system. The “In DateTime” has to be lesser than the “Out DateTime” and vice versa. So you have to set “In DateTime” as minimum DateTime and “Out DateTime” as maximum DateTime for selection in DateTimePicker control. 

The dates before min date and after the max date are considered as invalid dates and it is disabled for selection. 

In the following example May 10, 2015 09:00 AM is set as MinDateTime and May 20, 2015 09:00 PM set as MaxDateTime.

1. Add the following code in your CSHTML page to render DateTimePicker widget.


   ~~~ cshtml

	@*Add the following code example to the corresponding CSHTML page to render DateTimePicker widget with customized Min time and Max time*@

	@Html.EJ().DateTimePicker("DateTime").MinDateTime("05/10/2015 09:00 AM").MaxDateTime("05/20/2015 09:00 PM").Interval(30).Width("175px")

   ~~~
