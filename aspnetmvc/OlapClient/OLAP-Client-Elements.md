## OLAP Client: Elements 

### Cube Selector

Cube Selector allows you to browse and select a cube from the entire collection, populated by the data source.

#### Change the Cube

Cube can be changed by selecting a cube name from the list of names available within the Cube Selector drop-down list. When a cube is changed, the following elements refresh according to the new cube.

### Cube Dimension Browser

Cube Dimension Browser is a tree-view-like structure that organizes the dimensions, hierarchies, measures etc… from the selected cube into independent, logical groups.

_Table: List of nodes_

<table>
<tr>
<td>
Type Of Nodes</td><td>
Description</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Cube</td><td>
Multidimensional set of data used for dynamic analysis.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Measure Group</td><td>
Composition of a set of measures.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>

Folder that contains the dimension and measure.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Measure</td><td>
Actual set of measures that compose the measure group.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Dimension</td><td>
A name given to the parts of the cube that categorize the data, such as Date, Customer, etc. It contains hierarchy and level elements.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Attribute Hierarchy</td><td>
Level of attributes down the hierarchy.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
User-defined hierarchy</td><td>
Members of a dimension in a hierarchical structure.</td></tr>
</table>
Attribute Hierarchy

Attribute hierarchy contains the following levels:

* A leaf level contains each distinct attribute member called leaf member with each member of the leaf level.
* Intermediate levels if the attribute hierarchy is a parent-child hierarchy.
* An optional (All) level (IsAggregatable=True) containing the aggregated value of the attribute hierarchy's leaf members, with the member of the (All) level also known as the (All) member.

User-Defined Hierarchy

User-defined hierarchy organizes the members of a dimension into hierarchical structure and provides navigation paths in a cube. For example, take a dimension table that supports three attributes such as Year, Quarter and Month. The Year, Quarter and Month attributes are used to construct a user-defined hierarchy, named Calendar, in the time dimension.

Differentiating Attribute hierarchy and User-defined hierarchy

Attribute hierarchy and User-defined hierarchy are normally differentiated by their tree node image.

Draggable and non-draggable nodes in the Cube Dimension Browser

The dragabble nodes are:

* Measure
* Dimension
* Hierarchy
* Level Elements

The nodes that are not allowed to be dragged are:

* Cube
* Display Folder
### Axis Element Builder


Axis Element Builder allows you to build the element in an axis of the OLAP Client. It supports three axes namely: Categorical, Series and Slicer. Based on the elements constructed OLAP Grid and OLAP Chart will display the resultant data.

Categorical (Column)

The categorical axis defines one or more dimensions that are displayed along the chart's y-axis as labels and in the columns of the grid. If more than one dimension is on the categorical axis, the Chart/Grid will stack each dimension. The order in which the dimensions are stacked on the Chart/Grid is based on the order that they appear on the categorical axis.

Series (Row)

The series axis defines one or more dimensions that are displayed along the chart's x-axis as labels and in the rows of the grid. If more than one dimension is on the series axis, the Chart/Grid will stack each dimension. The order in which the dimensions are stacked on the Chart/Grid is based on the order that they appear on the series axis.

Slicer

The slicer axis is used as a filter to narrow the focus of the multidimensional data displayed in the Chart/Grid. The slicer axis lets you analyze any member of a dimension, in-depth. For the slicer to display the member's data, that member must not be present on both categorical axis and series axis.

#### Addition of Elements to an Axis Element Builder

##### Add Dimension, Hierarchy and Level to an Axis Element Builder 

The dimension, hierarchy and level elements can be dragged from the Cube Dimension Browser and dropped into the Axis Element Builder using the drag-and-drop operation. Also you can move the dimension, hierarchy and level elements from one axis to another by moving the appropriate Split Button.



{ ![Description: C:/Users/Tamilarasu .M/Pictures/document/adding measure.png](OLAP-Client-Elements_images/OLAP-Client-Elements_img11.png) | markdownify }
{:.image }


##### Add Measure to an Axis Element Builder

The measure elements can be dragged from Cube Dimension Browser and dropped into Axis Element Builder using drag-and-drop operation. Also user can move the measure elements from one axis to another by moving the Split Button named Measures.

#### Remove Elements from an Axis Element Builder

Remove Dimension, Hierarchy and Level from an Axis Element Builder

In order to remove dimension, hierarchy and level element from the Axis Element Builder, click the Remove symbol available next to the Split Button while hovering over it.

##### Remove Measure from an Axis Element Builder

To remove the measure element from the Axis Element Builder, click the Remove symbol available next to the Measures Split Button while hovering over it.

#### Rearrange Elements in an Axis Element Builder

Rearranging can be done by dragging an element one below the other.

### Split Button

Split Button highlights the elements in the Axis Element Builder. It holds dimensions/measures. When you drag and drop a node from Cube Dimensional Browser into Axis Element Builder, a Split Button is created, displaying the dimension name.

{ ![](OLAP-Client-Elements_images/OLAP-Client-Elements_img17.png) | markdownify }
{:.image }


When you drag and drop a measure, the Axis Element Builder will create a Split Button only for the first measure. The next time a measure is added, it maintains the same single Split Button to hold the entire measure collection.

##### Remove Split Button

Split Button can be removed with the help of the Remove option available while hovering over it.

### Elements Editor

Measure Editor 

Measure Editor is a dialog that displays the collection of measures in the current report.

Remove a Measure 

To remove a measure, click the Remove button next to the corresponding measure while hovering over it. To avoid removing the current selection, click Cancel.

Member Editor

Member Editor is a tree-view control that displays the member elements of the current dimension.

Represent State of Nodes of a dimension

Nodes are represented in two states, namely:

* Checked
* Unchecked

Select and Clear Nodes of a Dimension in the Member Editor

The option Select is provided in such a way that on selecting the parent node, its corresponding child nodes are automatically selected. If a leaf node is selected, it does not affect others since it is the final node on a tree.

Unchecking the check box option is provided in such a way that on deselecting the parent node, its corresponding child nodes are automatically deselected. On deselecting all the child nodes, its corresponding parent node is automatically deselected.



{ ![](OLAP-Client-Elements_images/OLAP-Client-Elements_img23.png) | markdownify }
{:.image }


Check All and Uncheck All

* Check All – Will select all nodes in the tree view.
* Uncheck All – Will uncheck all nodes in the tree view.

When a change is made in the report, OLAP visualization controls and Axis Element Builder get re-populated with the data contained in the selected report.

### OLAP Grid

The OLAP Grid control for ASP.NET MVC is easily configurable, presentation-quality business control that reads OLAP data from a Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services database, an offline cube or XMLA. The OLAP data is displayed with drill-up and drill-down capabilities and features exceptional performance.

### OLAP Chart

The OLAP Chart control for ASP.NET MVC is a lightweight control that reads OLAP information and visualizes it in graphical format with the ability to drill up and down.
