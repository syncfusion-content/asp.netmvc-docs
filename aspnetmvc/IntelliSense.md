# IntelliSense

The IntelliSense support is provided like the default ASP.NET MVC controls. It has the object list that holds the properties, public methods and event arguments of respective controls. On pressing the (.) Dot operator it displays those properties, public methods and event arguments of the corresponding control in the dropdown.

Refer to the following screenshot where the DatePicker control is used in the sample.
