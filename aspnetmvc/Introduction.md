# Welcome to Syncfusion Essential ASP.NET MVC

The **Syncfusion Essential Studio for ASP.NET MVC** is a set of server-side wrappers which is empowered by Essential JavaScript. With the help of the server-side wrapper helper classes, the user can add the Syncfusion MVC components into their application. The MVC helper’s values are passed from the server-side wrapper classes to browser via ScriptManager, the control creation and manipulations takes place in the client-side.

## How to best read this User Guide

* The best way to get started would be to read the common “[Getting Started](/aspnetmvc/getting-started)” document then read the “Getting Started” document of the component that you would like to start using first. The “Getting Started” guide gives just enough information that you need to know before starting to write code. This is the only section that we recommend reading end-to-end before starting to write code, all other information can be referred as needed.
* Now that you are familiar with the basics of using the component, the next step would be to start integrating the component into your application. A good starting point would be to refer to the code snippets in the [online sample browser](http://mvc.syncfusion.com/demos/web) which contains hundreds of code samples, it is very likely that you will find a code sample that resembles your intended usage scenario.
* After you have integrated the component into your application using one of the sample code snippets as a starting point, it is likely that you would want additonal information on specific features and API. The best option would be to search a specific topic using the search box that is available at the top of the user guide.
* Another valuable resource is the [API reference](http://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc/dociohelper) which provides detailed information on the object hierarchy as well as the settings available on every object.

## Additional Help Resources

* The [Knowledge Base](http://www.syncfusion.com/kb/aspnetmvc) section contains responses to some of the most common questions that other customers have asked us in the past so this would be a good place to search for topics that are not covered in the user guide.
