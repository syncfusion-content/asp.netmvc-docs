# Welcome to Syncfusion Essential ASP.NET MVC

The **Syncfusion Essential Studio for ASP.NET MVC** is a set of server-side wrappers that is empowered by Essential JavaScript. The user can add the Syncfusion MVC components into their application with the help of the server-side wrapper helper classes. The MVC helper’s values are passed from the server-side wrapper classes to browser via ScriptManager, the control creation and manipulations takes place in the client-side.

## How to best read this User Guide

* The best way to get started is to read the common “[Getting Started](/aspnetmvc/getting-started)” document for the component that you would like to start using first. The “Getting Started” guide gives enough information that you need to know before starting to write code. This is the only section that is recommended to read end-to-end before starting to write code, all the other information can be referred when needed.
* Once you get familiar with the basics of using the component, the next step will be to start integrating the component into your application. A good starting point will be to refer to the code snippets in the [online sample browser](http://mvc.syncfusion.com/demos/web) that contains hundreds of code samples, it is very likely that you will find a code sample that resembles your intended usage scenario.
* After integrating the component into your application using one of the sample code snippets as a starting point, it is likely that you would need additional information on specific features and API. The best option will be to search a specific topic using the search box that is available at the top of the user guide.
* Another valuable resource is the [API reference](http://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc/dociohelper) that provides detailed information on the object hierarchy as well as the settings available on every object.

## Additional Help Resources

* The [Knowledge Base](http://www.syncfusion.com/kb/aspnetmvc) section contains responses to some of the most common questions that other customers have asked us before. So this will be a good place to search for topics that are not covered in the user guide.
* Similar to the [Knowledge Base](http://www.syncfusion.com/kb/aspnetmvc), the [forum](http://www.syncfusion.com/forums/aspnetmvc) section also contains responses to questions that other customers have asked us before.
