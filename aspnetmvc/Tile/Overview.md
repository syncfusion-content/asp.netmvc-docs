# Tile

The Essential Studio for ASP.NET MVC Web Tiles are simple, opaque rectangles or squares and they are arrayed on the start screen in a grid-like pattern. Tapping or selecting a Tile, launches the app or does some other action that is represented by the Tile. Tiles are arranged in a group separated by columns that looks like a start screen of a device and it can be either static or live.
