Angularbinding is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. You can use HTML as your template language and extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and briefly.

In order to achieve Angular binding, you can refer the following script files. 

* angular.min.js
* ej.widget.angular.min.js
