# ASP.NET MVC Upgrade Project

Syncfusion Project Migration is a Visual Studio add-in that allows you to migrate the existing Syncfusion ASP.NET MVC Web Application from one Essential Studio version to another version.

Use the following steps to migrate your existing Syncfusion ASP.NET MVC Web Application:

1. To open Migration Wizard, follow either one of the options below: 

   **Option 1**  
   Click **Syncfusion Menu** and choose **Essential Studio for ASP.NET MVC (EJ1) > Migrate Projectâ€¦** in **Visual Studio**.

   **Option 2**  
   Right-click the **Syncfusion ASP.NET MVC Application** from Solution Explorer and select **Syncfusion Essential JS 1**. Choose **Migrate the Essential JS 1 Project to Another Version...**

4. Click the **Migrate** Button. The **Project Backup** dialog appears. In the dialog, if click **Yes**, it will backup the current project before migrating the Syncfusion project. If click **No**, it will migrate the project to required Syncfusion version without backup.

5. The Syncfusion reference assemblies, Scripts, CSS, and Web.Config entries are updated to the corresponding version in the project.

6. If you installed the trial setup or NuGet packages from nuget.org you have to register the Syncfusion license key to your project since Syncfusion introduced the licensing system from 2018 Volume 2 (v16.2.0.41) Essential Studio release. Navigate to the [help topic](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key#how-to-generate-syncfusion-license-key) to generate and register the Syncfusion license key to your project.
