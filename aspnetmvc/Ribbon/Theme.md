# Theme

_Ribbon_ control’s style and appearance are controlled based on _CSS_ classes. In order to apply styles to the _Ribbon_ control, refer to two files namely, _ej.widgets.core.min.css and ej.theme.min.css_ . When the file _ej.widgets.all.min.css_ is referred, it is not necessary to include the files _ej.widgets.core.min.css and ej.theme.min.css_ in your project as _ej.widgets.all.min.css_ is the combination of these two files.
