# ASP.NET MVC DataManager Overview

DataManager helps in managing relational data in the ASP.NET MVC. Its rich features make querying data sources easier. The ODataClient supports OData queries that are enabled in the Web API & WCF data services.

## DataManager supports different types of data binding such as:

1. JSON
2. Web Services
3. OData

Basically, all services that have JSON acts as a transport.

## Key Features

DataManager has many abilities and responsibilities, among which to:

1. **DataManager** - Communicates with data source and returns the desired result based on the Query provided.

2. **JavaScript Query** – **DataManager** have APIs for generating JavaScript data query with ease.

3. **CRUD in individual requests and Batch** – **CRUD** operations are fully supported. The options are enabled to commit the data as a single or multiple requests.

4. **Adaptors** – **Adaptors** are specific dataSource type aware interfaces that are used by **DataManager** to communicate with DataSource. Three adaptors are created. They are, ODataAdaptor, JsonAdaptor and UrlAdaptor

5. **Model binding** – Simple model binding is made using **DataManager**. You can directly bind Query result to **HTML** element.

6. Calculate and maintain aggregates, sorting order and paging

In other words, the DataManager fully supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) data operations, and provides both client-side and server-side support for sorting, paging, filtering, grouping, and aggregates.
