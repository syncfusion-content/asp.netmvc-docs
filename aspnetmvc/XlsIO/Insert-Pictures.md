Essential XlsIO has advanced API support for working with images. It supports the insertion of Scalar and Vector images in a worksheet. It is also possible to position and set the properties for the image at the desired location. IPictureShape is used for inserting and formatting pictures.

Barcodes and Charts can also be inserted in a spreadsheet by using XlsIO's Image Insertion API's. The barcode/chart is rendered to an image by using the Essential Barcode/ Essential Chart and then inserted into the spreadsheet as an image. XlsIO can also extract images from an existing spreadsheet.
