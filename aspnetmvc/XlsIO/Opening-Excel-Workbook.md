# Opening Excel Workbook

Essential XlsIO allows you to open the existing MS Excel workbook with an interface IWorkbooks. IWorkbooks is a collection of all the workbook objects that are currently open in the Excel application. This interface is responsible for adding new workbooks, opening existing workbooks, creating new workbooks, and copying workbooks. 

## Open Workbook as File

The following is the code example to open a document from file.



{% highlight c# %}



ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;


//Opens a workbook.
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic);

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vbnet %}



Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine()

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel


'Opens the workbook as file.
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic)

{% endhighlight %}

To open a binary excel document, the file name with the extension *.xls is sufficient.



{% highlight c# %}



ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;


//Opens the workbook.
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xls", ExcelOpenType.Automatic);

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}



Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine()

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel


'Opens the workbook as file.
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xls", ExcelOpenType.Automatic)

{% endhighlight %}

Opening a Workbook as a file in WinRT

The following is the code sample to open a document from file.



{% highlight c# %}



ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;


//Instantiates the File Picker.
FileOpenPicker openPicker = new FileOpenPicker();

openPicker.SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.Desktop;

openPicker.FileTypeFilter.Add(".xlsx");

openPicker.FileTypeFilter.Add(".xls");



StorageFile openFile = await openPicker.PickSingleFileAsync();

//Opens the workbook.
IWorkbook workbook = await application.Workbooks.OpenAsync(openFile);

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}



Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine()

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel


'Instantiates the File Save Picker.
Dim openPicker As New FileOpenPicker()
openPicker.SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.Desktop
openPicker.FileTypeFilter.Add(".xlsx")

openPicker.FileTypeFilter.Add(".xls")
Dim openFile As StorageFile = Await openPicker.PickSingleFileAsync()

'Opens the Workbook.
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = Await application.Workbooks.OpenAsync(openFile)

{% endhighlight %}

Opening a Workbook as a file in Windows Phone 8

The following is the code example to open a document from file.



{% highlight c# %}



ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

//Opens the workbook.
StorageFolder local = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;

StorageFile outFile = await local.GetFileAsync("Sample.xlsx");

IWorkbook workbook = await application.Workbooks.OpenAsync(outFile);


{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vbnet %}



Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine()

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel


'Opens the Workbook.
Dim local As StorageFolder = Windows.Storage. ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder
Dim outFile As StorageFile = Await local.GetFileAsync("Sample.xlsx")

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = Await application.Workbooks.OpenAsync(outFile)

{% endhighlight %}

## Open Workbook as a Stream 

The following is the code example to open a document from file.



{% highlight c# %}



ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

//Converts the file into a stream.
FileStream fileStream = new FileStream ("Sample.xlsx", FileMode.Open);

//Opens the workbook as a stream.
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open(fileStream, ExcelOpenType.Automatic);


{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vbnet %}



Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine()

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel


'Converts the file into a stream.
Dim fileStream As New FileStream("Sample.xlsx", FileMode.Open)

'Opens the workbook as a stream.
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open(fileStream, ExcelOpenType.Automatic)
{% endhighlight %}

Opening a Workbook as a stream in Windows Phone 8.



{% highlight c# %}

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

//Opens the file as a stream.
StorageFolder local = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;
Stream outFile = await local.OpenStreamForReadAsync("sample.xlsx");

//Opens the workbook.
IWorkbook workbook = await application.Workbooks.OpenAsync(outFile);

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}



Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine()

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel


'Opens the file as a stream.
Dim local As StorageFolder = Windows.Storage. ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder
Dim outFile As Stream = Await local.OpenStreamForReadAsync("Sample.xlsx")



'Opens the workbook.
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = Await application.Workbooks.OpenAsync(outFile)

{% endhighlight %}

## Open Workbook in Read-Only mode 

XlsIO allows you to open a spreadsheet in Read-Only mode, even if the spreadsheet is already open in your machine. 



{% highlight c# %}



ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

//Opens the workbook as Read only.
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.OpenReadOnly("Sample.xlsx");

{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight vbnet %}

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine()

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel


'Opens the workbook as Read only.
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.OpenReadOnly("Sample.xlsx")

{% endhighlight %}


### Open an Encrypted Workbook

This section illustrates how to open an encrypted document in XlsIO. To open an encrypted file, the password must be provided to decrypt the file. The following code example shows the way of decrypting a file to access its data.
