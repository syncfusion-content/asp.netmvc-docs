## Cell or Range Formatting

Data formatting gives a better readability and clear understanding of the data in the worksheet. Numerous formatting options are available like underlining, coloring, and so on, that organizes and clearly identifies the data within a worksheet. Minute refining options such as aligning the titles to center across the columns gives a professional appearance to the worksheet. 

Microsoft Excel provides various options to format these worksheets. XlsIO is also enriched with formatting options similar to MS Excel. The formatting capabilities of XlsIO are explained in the following sub-sections.

### Apply Default Style

Microsoft Excel provides support to create styles by using the Style dialog box (Go to the Format menu and click Styles command). It also permits to modify and add new styles that can be applied to a range of cells.

Applying Default style in XlsIO

XlsIO provides various ways to apply styles. IStyle interface is used for creating styles. You can set the default styles created with groups of styles to a range of rows and columns. This is the most optimized approach to format rows and columns with large number of cells with same styles.

The following code example illustrates how to create and apply default styles for a range of rows and columns.



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



// Defines the default styles that is to be applied to the rows and columns.

IStyle rowStyle = workbook.Styles.Add("RowStyle");

rowStyle.Color = Color.LightCoral;

IStyle columnStyle = workbook.Styles.Add("ColumnStyle");

columnStyle.Color = Color.Orange;



// Sets Column Default Style.

sheet.SetDefaultRowStyle(1, 2, rowStyle);



// Sets Column Default Style.

sheet.SetDefaultColumnStyle(1, 2, columnStyle); 



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();         



[VB.NET]



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2)



' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



' Defines the default styles that is to be applied to the rows and columns.

Dim rowStyle As IStyle = workbook.Styles.Add("RowStyle")

rowStyle.Color = Color.LightCoral

Dim columnStyle As IStyle = workbook.Styles.Add("ColumnStyle")

columnStyle.Color = Color.Orange



' Sets Column Default Style.

sheet.SetDefaultRowStyle(1, 2, rowStyle)



' Sets Column Default Style.

sheet.SetDefaultColumnStyle(1, 2, columnStyle)



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010

workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



' Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()

_Note: Applying custom styles will override the original styles._

### Apply Global Style

XlsIO provides support for adding and modifying common (or global) styles that can be applied to one or more cells in a workbook. These styles can be created and applied to several ranges of cells in the workbook. Note that the usage of common styles to format spreadsheets is the recommended approach since setting a separate style for each cell can reduce the performance considerably.

{:.image }
_Note: when you want to apply more than one style for cells, enclose the style within the Begin and End calls. This improves the performance._



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



// Formatting.



// Global styles should be used when the same style needs to be applied to more than 

// one cell. This usage of a global style reduces memory usage.



// Header Style.

IStyle headerStyle = workbook.Styles.Add("HeaderStyle");



// Adds custom colors to the palette.

headerStyle.BeginUpdate();

workbook.SetPaletteColor(8, Color.FromArgb(255, 174, 33));

headerStyle.Color = Color.FromArgb(255, 174, 33);

headerStyle.Font.Bold = true;

headerStyle.Borders[ExcelBordersIndex.EdgeLeft].LineStyle = ExcelLineStyle.Thin;

headerStyle.Borders[ExcelBordersIndex.EdgeRight].LineStyle = ExcelLineStyle.Thin;

headerStyle.Borders[ExcelBordersIndex.EdgeTop].LineStyle = ExcelLineStyle.Thin;

headerStyle.Borders[ExcelBordersIndex.EdgeBottom].LineStyle = ExcelLineStyle.Thin;

headerStyle.EndUpdate();



// Body Style.

IStyle bodyStyle = workbook.Styles.Add("BodyStyle");



// Adds custom colors to the palette.

bodyStyle.BeginUpdate();

workbook.SetPaletteColor(9, Color.FromArgb(239, 243, 247));

bodyStyle.Color = Color.FromArgb(239, 243, 247);

bodyStyle.Borders[ExcelBordersIndex.EdgeLeft].LineStyle = ExcelLineStyle.Thin;

bodyStyle.Borders[ExcelBordersIndex.EdgeRight].LineStyle = ExcelLineStyle.Thin;

bodyStyle.EndUpdate();



// Applies the defined styles.

// Applies Body Style.

### Apply Number FormatsÂ 

Number Formats are little code that help you control the appearance of numbers in the Excel. A number in a cell is displayed depending on the number format applied to it. The same number can be displayed in different formats also. For example, 1.5 may represent a half teaspoon in one spreadsheet, while the same 1.5 would represent somebody's age, another spreadsheet's percentage, or so on.

Microsoft Excel recognizes the numbers in various formats: Accounting, Scientific, Fractions, and Currency. MS Excel allows to set these number formats by using the Number tab in the Format Cells dialog box.

{{ '![](Cell-or-Range-Formatting_images/Cell-or-Range-Formatting_img5.png)' | markdownify }}
{:.image }


A number format consists of up to 4 items separated by semicolons. Each of the item is an individual number format. The first, by default, applies to positive numbers, the second to negative numbers, the third to zeros, and the forth to text. When you do not apply any special formatting to text, Excel uses the General number format that basically means anything that will fit. 

1. Long Numbers

You can make long numbers easier to read by inserting a thousands separator (a comma for US regional settings). The #, ##0 number format is used. This format does not allow Excel to use the shorter scientific format, so the longest numbers merely show #######, signifying that they do not fit in their cells. You can either AutoFit the column or specify the column width in order to avoid showing #######.

2. Hide Zeros

Excel allows hiding zero values from displaying when you are not interested in showing the values if it is 0. This can be done by setting custom format as General or 0.00.

3. Leading Zeros

Excel removes the zero (0) in the zip code. The reason is that zero is not required to display the value of the number. However, since number formats are not about the value, but are about the appearance, you can use a special format to retain the leading zeros, 00000. 

4. Special Number Formats

In addition to the 00000 Zip Code number format, Excel also has 00000-0000 for Zip-Plus-Four, 000-00-0000 for Social Security numbers, and (000)000-0000 for telephone numbers. When you live in a location that needs different zip codes, you can design your own custom number formats. The following table shows various custom formatting codes.

XlsIO provides the following properties to get/set the data in the cells.

1. DisplayText-Gets the text that is displayed in the cell. This is read-only property that returns a cell value that is displayed after the number format application.
2. Value-Gets/sets the string from it. Since you can assign different data types, Value property parses that input string to determine the type used, that is, it sequentially checks whether it is an empty cell, formula, boolean, error, number, or date time.
3. Value2-This object returns/sets the cell value. This property works in the following way. It first checks whether the specified object has the type known for it (DateTime, TimeSpan, Double, Int). If yes, then it uses the corresponding typed properties (DateTime, TimeSpan, and Number). Otherwise, it calls Value property with String data type.

The only difference between the Value2 property and the Value property is that the Value2 property does not use the Currency and Date data types and it does not support FormulaArray value.

IsStringsPreserved property of IWorksheet is used to modify its behavior and return boolean, double, or datetime. Otherwise, it returns Value property.

You can use these properties in the following ways.

* When you have an object and independent of its type, use Value2.
* When you have a string that can have different data types and do not want to parse it, use Value property.
* When you know the exact data (value of cell) type, use typed properties.

The following code example illustrates how to get the display text and value in the cell.

### Apply Cell Text Alignment

Text has to be aligned inside the cells to properly fit in any data. This is done in Excel by using the Horizontal and Vertical alignment settings either through the Formatting toolbar or through the options provided by the Alignment tab in the Format Cells dialog box. In addition to the Left, Center, and Right alignments, Horizontal alignment option goes further and allows text to be justified. This can be especially useful when the text is significantly long. Vertical alignment option allows you to align the contents of a cell towards the Top, Middle, or Bottom area of a cell.



{{ '![](Cell-or-Range-Formatting_images/Cell-or-Range-Formatting_img8.png)' | markdownify }}
{:.image }


Indentation

In some circumstances, you may neither want to center the text nor keep it left or right aligned. In such cases, indentation can be done. Indentation consists of pushing the text to the left or right without aligning it to the center. To indent a text, you need to specify the number of units in the Indent box.

Alignment Settings in XlsIO

XlsIO supports alignment properties similar to Excel. The following code example illustrates the alignment settings that can be applied to the cells by using XlsIO.

### Apply Colors

Color

MS Excel provides support to format its cells, rows, and columns with various colors and patterns. This can be done by using the Fill Color button and the associated palette.

{{ '![](Cell-or-Range-Formatting_images/Cell-or-Range-Formatting_img11.png)' | markdownify }}
{:.image }


A color is a 4-byte number of the format 00BBGGRR, where RR, GG, and BB values are the Red, Green, and Blue values, each of them between 0 and 255 (&HFF). When all component values are 0, the RGB color is 0 that is black. When all component values are 255 (&HFF), the RGB color is 16,777, 215 (&H00FFFFF), or white. All other color combinations of values for the red, green, and blue components.

Pattern

Excel provides various pattern styles for highlighting cells. These can be applied through the Pattern tab in the Format Cells dialog box. XlsIO includes APIs to specify the above background pattern for a cell. The following code example illustrates this.

### Apply Workbook Palette Colors

1. Color Palette

Excel supports colors for fonts and background fills through what is called the Color Palette. The Pallet is an array or series of 56 RGB colors. The value of each of those 56 colors may be any of the 16 million available colors. Thus the number of distinct colors in a workbook is limited to 56 colors. The RGB values in the Pallet are accessed by the ColorIndex property. The ColorIndex is an offset or index in the Pallet, and thus has a value between 1 and 56. In the default, unmodified Pallet, the 3rd element in the Palette is the RGB value 255 (&HFF) that is red.

When you format a cell's background to red, for example, you are actually assigning to the ColorIndex property of the Interior a value of 3. Excel reads the 3 in the ColorIndex property, and goes to the 3rd element of the Palette to get the actual RGB color. If you modify the Palette, say by changing the 3rd element from red (255 = &HFF) to blue (16,711,680 = &HFF0000), all items that were once red are changed to blue. This is because the value of the 3rd element in the Pallet has been changed from red to blue, while the ColorIndex property remains equal to 3.

You can change the values in the default palette by modifying the Colors in the array of the workbook. You can also get the colors in the palette by using the Palette property.

2. Colors in XlsIO

XlsIO provides support for adding new colors to the color palette that are not available in the standard MS Excel color palette by using the SetPaletteColor method. When you have modified a workbook's Palette, you can reset the palette back to the default values by using the ResetPalette method. The following code example illustrates how to set the color palette.



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



// Creates color palette.

string[] known = Enum.GetNames( typeof( KnownColor ) );

Color[] palette = workbook.Palette;



for( int i = ( int )ExcelKnownColors.Custom0; i < palette.Length; i++ )

{

        KnownColor value = ( KnownColor )Enum.Parse( typeof( KnownColor ), known[i] );

        workbook.SetPaletteColor( i, Color.FromKnownColor( value ) );

}



palette = workbook.Palette;

int pos = 0;

for( int j=1; j<100; j++ )

{

        for( int i=1; i<=3; i++ )

        {

                ExcelKnownColors knownEnm = (ExcelKnownColors)pos;

                sheet.Range[ j, i ].CellStyle.ColorIndex = knownEnm;

                sheet.Range[ j, i ].Text = palette[ pos ].Name + ", " +

                        string.Format( "R{0}:G{1}:B{2}:A{3}", palette[ pos ].R, 

                        palette[ pos ].G, palette[ pos ].B, palette[ pos ].A );

                pos++;



                if( pos >= palette.Length ) break;

        }

        if( pos >= palette.Length ) break;

} 



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();

Dim palette As Color() = workbook.Palette



Dim i As Integer = CInt(ExcelKnownColors.Custom0)



Do While i < palette.Length

        Dim value As KnownColor = CType(System.Enum.Parse(GetType(KnownColor), known(i)), KnownColor)

        workbook.SetPaletteColor(i, Color.FromKnownColor(value))

        i += 1

Loop



palette = workbook.Palette

Dim pos As Integer = 0

For j As Integer = 1 To 99

    For i = 1 To 3

        Dim knownEnm As ExcelKnownColors = CType(pos, ExcelKnownColors)

        sheet.Range(j, i).CellStyle.ColorIndex = knownEnm

        sheet.Range(j, i).Text = palette(pos).Name & ", " & String.Format("R{0}:G{1}:B{2}:A{3}", palette(pos).R, palette(pos).G, palette(pos).B, palette(pos).A)

        pos += 1



        If pos >= palette.Length Then

            Exit For

        End If

    Next i



    If pos >= palette.Length Then

        Exit For

    End If

Next j



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010



workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



' Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()



XlsIO also enables you to get or set the closest RGB color in the palette by using the SetColorOrGetNearest method. It returns the ColorIndex value of the color in the Palette that is closest to a given RGBLong color value. The method used here considers every RGB color to be a spatial location in a 3-dimensional space where the axes are Red, Green, and Blue components of an RGB Long value. Closest is taken in the geometrical sense, the distance between two colors in a 3-dimensional space with axes of Red, Green, and Blue values, that is, a color is identified spatially by the values of the Red, Green, and Blue components. The distances between the spatial location of RGBLong and each Color of the pallet is computed and the ColorIndex that minimizes this distance is returned. The distance between RGBLong and each Color (ColorIndex) value is computed by simple Pythagorean distance (without Square root):

Dist = ((R1-R2) ^2 + (G1-G2) ^2 + (B1-B2) ^2)

Where R1, G1, and B1 are the components of RGBLong and R2, G2, and B2 are the components of each Color (ColorIndex) value.

### Apply Borders

Microsoft Excel provides a default appearance for a cell background. For example, it surrounds the cell with a gray border and a white background. You can control this default appearance through the Formatting toolbar or the Border tab in the Format Cells dialog box.

Locking and Unlocking in XlsIO

XlsIO supports locking and unlocking cells by using the cell's Locked property that can be manipulated to make certain cells editable in a protected worksheet. Note that locking/unlocking a cell in an unprotected worksheet has no effect. For protecting the worksheet, see Worksheet Protection.



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// Opens the Existing (Protected) Worksheet from a Workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()



### Conditional FormattingÂ 

Conditional Formatting is a feature where the contents of a cell are dynamically formatted. It allows you to define and apply formatting to some cells, text, and numbers, based on the criteria that is set. For example, you can format a time sheet to point out the overtime obtained by the employee. You can also use it to track the best sales employees in a company by setting a quota that makes a cell range particular.

In MS Excel, click the Format menu and then click Conditional Formatting. You can use any criteria of your choice. The formatting can be applied to cells' values or a particular formula.

4. Using FormulaR1C1 property in Conditional Formats

XlsIO returns or sets the formula for the conditional format by using R1C1-style notation. The following code example illustrates this.



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Using FormulaR1C1 property in Conditional Formatting. 

IConditionalFormats condition = sheet.Range["E5:E18"].ConditionalFormats;



IConditionalFormat condition1 = condition.AddCondition();



condition1.FirstFormulaR1C1 = "=R[1]C[0]" ;

condition1.SecondFormulaR1C1 = "=R[1]C[1]" ;



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);

' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)

'Uses FormulaR1C1 property in Conditional Formatting.

Dim condition As IConditionalFormats = sheet.Range("E5:E18").ConditionalFormats

Dim condition1 As IConditionalFormat = condition.AddCondition()           

condition1.FirstFormulaR1C1 = "=R[1]C[0]" 

condition1.SecondFormulaR1C1 = "=R[1]C[1]" 



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010



workbook.SaveAs(fileName)

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()



#### Conditional Format TypesÂ 

Excel 2007 introduces a new formatting that highlights cells once they meet their respective constraints. Three new visualizations such as DataBars, Color Scales, and Icon Sets help you explore large datasets, identify trends and exceptions, and quickly compare data.

Data Bars

Data Bars give you an opportunity to create visual effects in your data that help you see how the value of a cell is compared with other cells. Excel compares the values in each of the selected cells and draws a data bar in each cell representing the value of that cell relative to the other cells in the selected range. This bar provides a clear visual cue, making it easier to pick out larger and smaller values in a range.

{{ '![](Cell-or-Range-Formatting_images/Cell-or-Range-Formatting_img24.jpeg)' | markdownify }}
{:.image }


MS Excel enables setting these formats through the Conditional Formatting menu. It also allows you to set the criteria through the New Formatting Rule dialog box as follows.

{{ '![](Cell-or-Range-Formatting_images/Cell-or-Range-Formatting_img25.jpeg)' | markdownify }}
{:.image }


Color Scales

Color Scales let you create visual effects in your data to compare the value of a cell with the values in a range of cells. A color scale uses cell shading as opposed to bars to communicate relative values. This is especially useful when you want to communicate more about your data beyond the relative size of the value of a cell.

{{ '![](Cell-or-Range-Formatting_images/Cell-or-Range-Formatting_img26.jpeg)' | markdownify }}
{:.image }


You can customize the criteria through the New Formatting Rule dialog box in MS Excel.

Icon Sets

Icon Sets give you an opportunity to create visual effects in your data to see how the value of a cell is compared with other cells. Excel 2007 offers several choices of icon sets. You can choose the icons that are most appropriate for the data you are using. Icon Sets come in three sizes that enables increase or decrease of the font size of the icon and it becomes larger or smaller appropriately.

{{ '![](Cell-or-Range-Formatting_images/Cell-or-Range-Formatting_img28.jpeg)' | markdownify }}
{:.image }


It is possible to hide the value of the cell and just draw the icon while applying a conditional formatting rule for icon sets by using the New Formatting Rule dialog box.

Visualization in XlsIO

XlsIO also provides support for visualizations through IDataBar, IconSet, and IColorScale interfaces. You can also customize these visualizations by specifying the criteria using XlsIO. The following code example illustrates how to apply and customize various visualizations.



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Adds condition for the range.
IConditionalFormats conditionalFormats = sheet.Range["C7:C46"].ConditionalFormats;
IConditionalFormat conditionalFormat = conditionalFormats.AddCondition();

// Sets Data bar and icon set for the same cell.
// Sets the conditionalFormat type.
conditionalFormat.FormatType = ExcelCFType.DataBar;

dataBar.MinPoint.Value = "0";
dataBar.MaxPoint.Type = ConditionValueType.HighestValue;
dataBar.MaxPoint.Value = "0";

// Sets color for Bar.
dataBar.BarColor = Color.FromArgb(156, 208, 243);

//Hides the value in data bar.
dataBar.ShowValue = false;
dataBar.BarColor = Color.Red;
dataBar.ShowValue = false;

//Adds another condition in the same range.

conditionalFormat = conditionalFormats.AddCondition();
conditionalFormat.FormatType = ExcelCFType.ColorScale;
IColorScale colorScale = conditionalFormat.ColorScale;

// Sets 3 - color scale.
colorScale.SetConditionCount(3);
colorScale.Criteria[0].FormatColorRGB = Color.FromArgb(230, 197, 218);
colorScale.Criteria[0].Type = ConditionValueType.LowestValue;
