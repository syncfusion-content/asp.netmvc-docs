## Worksheet Cells Manipulation

The IRange interface represents a single cell or a group of cells in a worksheet. XlsIO has several useful methods for manipulating data and formatting it in the ranges.

### Accessing a Cell or a Range

Range of cells can be accessed through the IRange interface. The following code example illustrates this.



[C#]



//Gets cell range.

IRange this[string name] { get; }



// Gets/sets cell by row and index.

IRange this[int row, int column] { get; }



//Gets cell range.

IRange this[string name, bool IsR1C1Notation] { get; }



//Gets cells range.

IRange this[int row, int column, int lastRow, int lastColumn] { get; }



> { ![](Worksheet-Cells-Manipulation_images/Worksheet-Cells-Manipulation_img1.jpeg) | markdownify }
{:.image }
_Note: Here row and column indexes in the range are "one based". Following code example explains various ways of accessing cells._



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



// Method 1 to Access a Range.

sheet.Range["A7"].Text = "Accessing a Range (Method 1)";



// Method 2 to Access a Range.

sheet.Range[9, 1].Text = "Accessing a Range (Method 2)";



// Method 3 to Access a Range(by using defined names).

sheet.Range["Name"].Text = "Accessing a Range (Method 3)";



// Accesses a Range of cells (Method 1).

sheet.Range["A13:C13"].Text = "Accessing a Range of Cells (Method 1)";



// Accesses a Range of cells (Method 2).

sheet.Range[15, 1, 15, 3].Text = "Accessing a Range of Cells (Method 2)";



// Accesses a Range of cells (Method 3 using defined names).

sheet.Range["Name1"].Text = "Accessing a Range of Cells (Method 3)";



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();



[VB.NET]



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2)



' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



' Method 1 to Access a Range.

sheet.Range("A7").Text = "Accessing a Range (Method 1)"



' Method 2 to Access a Range.

sheet.Range(9, 1).Text = "Accessing a Range (Method 2)"



' Method 3 to Access a Range(using defined names).

sheet.Range("Name").Text = "Accessing a Range (Method 3)"



' Accesses a Range of cells (Method 1).

sheet.Range("A13:C13").Text = "Accessing a Range of Cells (Method 1)"



' Accesses a Range of cells (Method 2).

sheet.Range(15, 1, 15, 3).Text = "Accessing a Range of Cells (Method 2)"



' Accesses a Range of cells (Method 3 using defined names).

sheet.Range("Name1").Text = "Accessing a Range of Cells (Method 3)"



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010



workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



' Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()



Accessing Discontinuous Ranges

You can also access different discontinuous ranges and add them to the RangesCollection so that the same format is applied to different ranges. The following code example explains the same.



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



IRange range1 = sheet.Range[ "A1:A2" ];

IRange range2 = sheet.Range["C1:C2" ];



IRanges ranges = sheet.CreateRangesCollection();



ranges.Add( range1 );

ranges.Add( range2 );

ranges.Text = "Test";



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();



[VB.NET]



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2)



' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



Dim range1 As IRange = sheet.Range("A1:A2")

Dim range2 As IRange = sheet.Range("C1:C2")



Dim ranges As IRanges = sheet.CreateRangesCollection()



ranges.Add(range1)

ranges.Add(range2)

ranges.Text = "Test"



tring fileName = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010



workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



' Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()



Access by using IMigrantRange for better performance

The IMigrantRange interface can be used to access a worksheet range and manipulate it. This is an optimal method of writing data with better performance. The following code example illustrates this.



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



IMigrantRange migrantRange = sheet.MigrantRange;



// Writes Data.

for (int row = 1; row <= rowCount; row++)

{

    for (int column = 1; column <= colCount; column++)

    {

// Writes values.

        migrantRange.ResetRowColumn(row, column);

        migrantRange.Text = "Test";

    }

}



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();



[VB.NET]



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2)



' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



Dim migrantRange As IMigrantRange = sheet.MigrantRange



' Writes Data.

Dim row As Integer



For  row = 1 To  rowCount Step  row + 1

Dim column As Integer

      For  column = 1 To  colCount Step  column + 1



' Writes values.

            migrantRange.ResetRowColumn(row, column)

            migrantRange.Text = "Test"

      Next

Next



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010

workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



' Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()



### Accessing used range of a Worksheet 

XlsIO enables you to get the range of cells used in a given sheet. This helps you to apply the same format to all the cells used in the worksheet. You can also get the first row/column, last row/column, and number of rows/columns used in the sheet by using the various methods of IRange.

> { ![](Worksheet-Cells-Manipulation_images/Worksheet-Cells-Manipulation_img2.jpeg) | markdownify }
{:.image }
_Note: By default, XlsIO considers a cell as used, even when there exists some formatting. You can disable this behavior, and make XlsIO consider a cell as used, only when there exists data, by using the UsedRangeIncludesFormatting property._

The following code example is used to format the Used Range.



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



// Modifies only the Used Ranges.

sheet.UsedRange.ColumnWidth = 20;

sheet.UsedRange.RowHeight = 20;



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();



[VB.NET]



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2)



' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



' Modifies only the Used Ranges.

sheet.UsedRange.ColumnWidth = 20

sheet.UsedRange.RowHeight = 20



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010

workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



' Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()



### Clear a Cell or a Range

While editing Excel workbooks, one of the most common action that is performed is clearing or deleting cells. Clearing cells mean erasing everything within them, whereas deleting actually deletes the entire cell. You can clear the cell content by using the Clear method. XlsIO also provides options to clear styles or data alone.

The following code example illustrates how to clear a range along with its formatting.



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



// Cleares a Range and its formatting.

sheet.Range["A4"].Clear(true);



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();



[VB.NET]



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2)



' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



' Cleares a Range and its formatting.

sheet.Range("A4").Clear(True)



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010



workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



' Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()



### Copy or Move a Range

Moving or copying cells is a very common procedure while creating or editing your worksheets. XlsIO provides support to copy a range of cells from one end to another. CopyTo method enables copying range of cells from the source to the destination. It has an option to copy all the formats or only specific formats to the destination range by using the ExcelCopyRangeOptions enumerator. Following.



_Table_ _14__: Values set for the ExcelCopyRangeOptions_

<table>
<tr>
<td>
Members </td><td>
Description</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
None</td><td>
Indicates to copy only the cell value. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
UpdateFormulas</td><td>
Indicates formula during copy. WARNING: You should always specify this flag when your operations can change the position of Array formula. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
UpdateMerges</td><td>
Indicates to update merges during copy.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
CopyStyles</td><td>
Indicates to copy styles during range copy. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>

<tr>
<td>
CopyConditionalFormats</td><td>
Indicates to copy conditional formats during range copy. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
All</td><td>
Indicates functionionality of all the above flags. </td></tr>
</table>


The following code example illustrates how to copy a range of cells from the source to the destination.



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



// Copies a Range.



IRange source = sheet.Range["A1"];

IRange des = sheet.Range["A5"];

source.CopyTo(des);



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();



[VB.NET]



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2)



' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



' Copies a Range.

Dim source As IRange = sheet.Range("A1")

Dim des As IRange = sheet.Range("A5")

source.CopyTo(des)



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010

workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



' Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()



MoveTo method is used to move a range of cells to the destination. The only difference between copy and move operation is that Move does not create a copy in the source. This is similar to the Cut and Paste options in the Excel. 

> { ![](Worksheet-Cells-Manipulation_images/Worksheet-Cells-Manipulation_img3.jpeg) | markdownify }
{:.image }
_Note: Move does not update formulas._



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



// Moves a Range.



IRange source = sheet.Range["A1"];

IRange des = sheet.Range["A5"];

source.MoveTo(des);



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();



[VB.NET]



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2)



' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



' Moves a Range.

Dim source As IRange = sheet.Range("A1")

Dim des As IRange = sheet.Range("A5")

source.MoveTo(des)



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010

workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



' Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()

### Data Sorting 

This feature allows sorting any range of cells dynamically at runtime without any dependency on MS Excel. You can sort a given range of cells in a worksheet by applying the sort feature to a range that changes the related data within the range. The ranges can be sorted in the following ways:

1. Sorting by Cell Values
2. Sorting by Font Color
3. Sorting by Cell Color

### Data Filtering  

MS Excel AutoFilter feature literally makes filtering out unwanted data in a data list as easy as clicking a button. When the cell pointer is located within any cell in your data list, open the Data tab, click Filter button. Once this is done, the program adds drop-down buttons to each of the field names in the top row of the list. This feature is specifically used in large spreadsheets when you want to look for a particular data based on specific criteria.



{ ![](Worksheet-Cells-Manipulation_images/Worksheet-Cells-Manipulation_img9.png) | markdownify }
{:.image }


AutoFilters in Essential XlsIO

Essential XlsIO also comes with APIs for reading and writing AutoFilters in a worksheet. You can specify the range of data that needs to be viewed through the FilterRange property. The following code example illustrates writing AutoFilters.



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



// Creates an AutoFilter in the first worksheet. Specifies the AutoFilter range. 

sheet.AutoFilters.FilterRange = sheet.Range["A1:B7"]; 



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";
workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;

workbook.SaveAs(fileName);

// Closes the workbook.
workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();



[VB.NET]



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2)



' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



' Creates an AutoFilter in the first worksheet. Specifies the AutoFilter range. 

sheet.AutoFilters.FilterRange = sheet.Range("A1:B7") 



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010

workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



' Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()



XlsIO also provides options to set the built-in conditions for filters by using various properties of IAutoFilter. The following code example illustrates various conditions based on the data that is to be filtered.



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



// Creates an AutoFilter in the first worksheet. Specifies the AutoFilter range. 

sheet.AutoFilters.FilterRange = sheet.Range["A1:B7"]; 



IAutoFilter filter = sheet.AutoFilters[0];

filter.IsTop = true;

filter.IsTop10 = true;

filter.Top10Number = 5;



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);

### Adding Hyperlinks 

A Hyperlink is a convenient way to instantly access another place in the workbook, or another workbook, or a file associated with another application. A hyperlink can be inserted in a cell or a shape in Excel. Select the cell or shape, and select Hyperlink from the Insert menu, or right-click anywhere in the cell or shape, and then select Hyperlink from the pop-up menu. You can enter a cell reference in the current workbook, browse to another workbook, a different file, or a web page, and even enter an email address and subject line. You can also edit the text for a hyperlink in a cell. Following is the Insert Hyperlink dialog box of MS Excel that allows setting various hyperlinks.

{ ![](Worksheet-Cells-Manipulation_images/Worksheet-Cells-Manipulation_img14.png) | markdownify }
{:.image }




XlsIO provides support to set the following types of hyperlinks with the Type and Address properties of the IHyperlink interface.

* Hyperlink to a Worksheet Range
* Hyperlink to Website
* Hyperlink to e-mail
* Hyperlink to external files

You can also set the text to be displayed in a hyperlink and a tooltip that shows the purpose of the link by using the TextToDisplay and ScreenTip properties. The following code example illustrates how to insert various hyperlinks.



[C#]



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.
