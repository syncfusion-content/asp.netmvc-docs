# Working with Other Drawing Objects 

Essential XlsIO supports working with form controls, OLE objects, and auto-shapes. The following sections explain those in detail.

## Insert Form Controls 

Essential XlsIO provides support to read and write the Text Box, Check Box, and Combo Box controls. It enables creation of forms that are user-friendly and also enhances the appearance of the forms.

N> Essential XlsIO provides support to read and write Form controls. Support for Active X Form controls is not yet available.

This section explains the usage of the following Form controls.

* Text Box
* Check Box
* Combo Box
* Option Button

### Text Box


Essential XlsIO can read and write text boxes. The ITextBoxShape interface lets you add a new text box inside a worksheet. The IFill interface is used to customize the inner appearance of the textbox. IShapeLineFormat interface is used to modify the border. Various other properties like Horizontal and Vertical Alignment, Alternative Text, Text Rotation, and so on, are also supported.

// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



//Filling Values.

sheet["A2"].Text = "Syncfusion Reporting Products";

sheet["A3"].Text = "Essential XlsIO";

sheet["A4"].Text = "Essential DocIO";

sheet["A5"].Text = "Essential Pdf";



sheet["B5"].Text = "Selected Index";



// Creates a Combo Box.

IComboBoxShape comboBox1 = sheet.ComboBoxes.AddComboBox(2, 3, 20, 100);



// Assigns a value to the Combo Box.

comboBox1.ListFillRange = sheet["A3:A5"];

comboBox1.LinkedCell = sheet["C5"];



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

## Insert OLE Objects 

Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) is one of the best known ways to insert data into Microsoft Office documents. Though embedding or linking objects increases the size of the original document, it helps improve the document readability by providing offline reading of documents (where the existing online links can be replaced). In order to read the content of the object, associated software needs to be installed in the machine. For example, a PDF file linked or embedded to an Excel file needs Adobe Reader in order to launch and read the PDF file. Essential XlsIO supports read and write of OLE Objects in XLSX file format. Objects can either be linked or embedded in the Excel documents by using IOleObject interface. 

N> Currently read and write functions for OLE Objects are supported in Windows, ASP.NET, and WPF platforms only.

##OLE Objects and Linking Types

XlsIO supports two types of association of objects:

* Objects can be linked to the program 
* Objects can be embedded in the program

1.  Linked Objects 

	Linked objects remain as separate files. The linked object would expect the object to be in the same location as created when the file is opened in another machine.

	Linking an OLE Object to an Excel document

	The following code example illustrates how to link an OLE Object to an Excel document.

	~~~ cs



		// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

		ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



		// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

		IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



		// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

		// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

		IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



		IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



		Image image = Image.FromFile("image.png");



		// Selects the object, the image for the display icon, and the type of the OLEObject to insert.

		IOleObject ole2 = sheet.OleObjects.Add("Document.docx", image, OleLinkType.Link);



		// Sets the location.

		ole2.Location = sheet[5, 12];



		// Sets the size

		ole2.Size = new Size(30, 30);

		string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

		workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



		workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



		// Closes the workbook.

		workbook.Close();

		excelEngine.Dispose();

2. Embedded Objects  

	Embedded objects are stored in the document. When a file is opened in another machine, the embedded object can be viewed without having access to the original data.

	Embedding an OLE Object in an Excel document

	The following code example illustrates how to embed an OLE Object to an Excel document.

    ~~~ cs



		// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

		ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



		// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

		Image image = Image.FromFile("image.png");



		// Selects the object, the image for the display icon, and the type of the OLEObject to insert.

		IOleObject ole1 = sheet.OleObjects.Add("Test.pptx", image, OleLinkType.Embed);



		// Sets the location.

		ole1.Location = sheet[5, 2];



		// Sets the size.

		ole1.Size = new Size(30, 30);

## Insert AutoShapes 

AutoShapes help you draw objects on your document. You can create various shapes by using AutoShapeType enumeration. Once you insert an AutoShape, you can also put a text inside it and you can move or resize them as you wish

The IShape interface is the in-memory representation of the AutoShapes in an Excel workbook. These are used to create Autoshapes and to set properties for those shapes The ITextFrame interface can be used to set various shape text formats.

###Features
