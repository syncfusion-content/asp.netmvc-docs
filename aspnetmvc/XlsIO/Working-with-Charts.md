# Working with Charts 

This section explains the usage of the Essential XlsIO's Chart APIs.

Charts can convey much more than numbers and makes it easier to see the meaning behind the numbers. Essential XlsIO has advanced support for creating and modifying Excel charts inside a workbook. There is an option to choose between creating an Embedded Chart (chart is embedded inside a worksheet) or a Chart Worksheet (chart is a separate worksheet).

## Create a Chart 

Essential XlsIO has APIs for creating an embedded chart. The IChartShape interface represents the embedded chart's in-memory, and this object can be used to format and modify the chart settings for chart area, plot area, and chart title area, with gradient, texture, patterns and pictures. A chart in XlsIO can be created either through the Data Range of the chart or by adding series one by one. The following code example illustrates how to create a chart through the Data Range.

{% highlight C# %}



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic)

;



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



//Creates a Chart.

IChartShape chart = sheet.Charts.Add();



//Sets Chart Type.

chart.ChartType = ExcelChartType.Column_Clustered;



//Sets Data Range.

chart.DataRange = sheet.Range["A1:E5"];



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();         
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight vbnet %}



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic)



'Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



'Creates a Chart.

Dim chart As IChartShape = sheet.Charts.Add()



'Sets Chart Type.

chart.ChartType = ExcelChartType.Column_Clustered



'Sets Data Range.

chart.DataRange = sheet.Range("A1:E5")



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010



workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



'Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()
{% endhighlight %}

## Chart Data Settings 

IChartFrameFormat can be used to change the format of the chart. IChartSeries is used to format the series. XlsIO provides options to enable/disable Legends and Data Tables by using the HasLegend and HasDataTable properties. You can also resize and position the embedded chart in a worksheet.

## Creating Custom Charts 

Custom charts can be created at runtime by using XlsIO. A chart is composed of data series. Each data series in XlsIO is represented by a series object, whereas series collection object serves as a collection of Series objects.When creating a custom chart, there is freedom to use different types of charts for different data series. The following code example demonstrates how to create custom charts. In this example, use a column chart for the first data series and a line chart for the second series. The result is to add a column chart combined with a line chart to the worksheet.

## Positioning Charts and Chart Elements

Charts and Chart elements such as chart title, legend, and plot area can be positioned easily as needed. To avoid spacing problems caused by the large charts, lengthy chart titles, plot area, or legends, you can change the position of these elements. 

##Positioning Chart

Chart created in a worksheet by using IChartShape interface can be positioned by row and column based. The following code example illustrates how to position a chart in a worksheet.

## Using Sparklines 

In MS Excel, the Sparklines can be inserted by selecting any of the sparklines type from the Insert tab. 

![](Working-with-Charts_images/Working-with-Charts_img2.png)



MS Excel allows you to select the range of data for the Sparklines creation. It also allows you to choose where the sparklines can be placed. The Sparklines appear once you select the data range and the location range. Now, you can customize the apperance of Sparklines in terms of color, style, etc. A group of Sparkline tools are available on the ribbon to change the high point, low point, color, edit the sparkline data, etc.

###Sparkline Creation by Using XlsIO

XlsIO provides support for creation of Sparklines by using simple APIs. 

* ISparklineGroups interface caches the SparklineGroup that needs to be added to the Spreadsheet. 
* ISparklineGroup represents Sparklines in object, and has properties that allows  to customize it. 
* ISparklines interface returns the collection of Sparkline present in a Worksheet. 
* ISparkline represents a sparkline in the Sparklines. Currently, XlsIO supports all the three types of sparklines--Line, Column, Win/Loss that are supported in Excel 2010.

The following code example illustrates how to create Sparklines by using XlsIO.

{% highlight C# %}



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

//Adds the sparklines.

## Insert Pictures 

Excel allows you to insert a picture through the Insert tab -> Illustrations section,and then clicking Pictures button. It allows you to customize the image by sizing, formatting, and positioning the image.

![](Working-with-Charts_images/Insert-Pictures_img1.png)



Essential XlsIO has advanced API support for working with images. It supports the insertion of Scalar and Vector images in a worksheet. It is also possible to position and set the properties for the image at the desired location. IPictureShape is used for inserting and formatting pictures.

## Insert Comments 

Microsoft Excel has the ability to insert comments in cells. Comments give additional information about a cell, such as, what the value represents. You can insert and format comments through the Insert menu in Excel. You can also format the comments inserted through the Format Comment dialog box.

![](Working-with-Charts_images/Insert-Comments_img1.png)



XlsIO has APIs for inserting both Regular and Rich Text comments by using the ICommentShape interface. It has various properties to format the comments. The following code example illustrates how to insert comments.
