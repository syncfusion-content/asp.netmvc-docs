# Working with Formulas 

Formulas are entries in Excel that have equations where values are calculated for display. A typical formula might contain cells, constants, and even functions. Essential XlsIO has advanced support for working with Formulas. The following topics elaborate on the various types of formulas and their support by XlsIO.

## Using Formulas or Functions 

Excel supports various built-in functions that make large calculations in large sheets easier. The following sections illustrate the usage in XlsIO.

### Writing a Formula

In a spreadsheet, formulas can be entered by using the Formula property. The following code example illustrates the built-in function of Excel by using XlsIOAPIs.

{% highlight C# %} 



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



sheet.Range["C1"].Formula = "SUM(A1,B1)";



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.



workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();         

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %} 



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2)



' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



sheet.Range("C1").Formula = "SUM(A1,B1)"



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010



workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



' Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()

{% endhighlight %}

##Writing a Formula across Worksheets

* Sheet1 and Sheet2 are the default names of the worksheets.
* In addition to being able to access values in the same worksheet, you can also access values across worksheets. Assume that B is present on the second worksheet, then use the following code for calculation. 



{% highlight C# %} 



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



sheet.Range["C2"].Formula = "=SUM(Sheet2!B2,Sheet1!A2)";



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();         
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight vbnet %}



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2)



' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



sheet.Range("C2").Formula = "=SUM(Sheet2!B2,Sheet1!A2)"



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010



workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



' Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()
{% endhighlight %}

### Reading a Formula

XlsIO allows you to read formulas from a cell. The following code example illustrates how to read the formula from a cell.

{% highlight C# %}



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



//Returns the formula in A1 style notation.

string formula = sheet["C1"].Formula;



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();         
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight vbnet %}



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic)



' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



'Returns the formula in A1 style notation.

Dim formula as String = sheet("C1").Formula



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010



workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



' Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()
{% endhighlight %}

### Applying Augment Separators Based on Cultures

Formula separators vary for each culture/regional settings and throws exception if valid separators are not used for specific culture. This can be overcome by setting the separators by using the SetSeparators method of IWorkbook. The following code example illustrates how to change the formula separators through XlsIO.

{% highlight C# %} 



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



workbook.SetSeparators(";", ",");



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();         
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight vbnet %}



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2)



' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



workbook.SetSeparators(";", ",")



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010



workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



' Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()
{% endhighlight %}

### Accessing Calculated value

XlsIO allows you to read formula from a cell and its calculated value. To perfom a calculation, the method EnableSheetCalculations in the worksheet object must be invoked. The following code example illustrates how a formula can be accessed and a calculated value accessed.

{% highlight C# %}



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



//Initializes Calculate Engine to perform the calculation.

sheet.EnableSheetCalculations();



//Returns the calculated value of a formula by using the current inputs.

string calculatedValue = sheet["C1"].CalculatedValue;



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();         

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic)



' Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



'Initializes Calculate Engine to perform calculation.

sheet.EnableSheetCalculations()



'Returns the calculated value of a formula by using the current inputs.

Dim calculatedValue As String = sheet("C1").CalculatedValue



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010

workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



'Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()

{% endhighlight %}

You can also get the Formula values as bool, date, and number type. Note that XlsIO can only read already computed formulas and cannot compute. CalculatedValue property must be called in prior to use these properties.

{% highlight C# %}



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



//Initializes Calculate Engine to perform calculation.

sheet.EnableSheetCalculations();



//Returns the calculated value of a formula by using the current inputs.

string calculatedValue = sheet["C1"].CalculatedValue;



//Returns Boolean value evaluated by the formula.

bool boolValue = sheet["C1"].FormulaBoolValue;



//Returns dateTime value evaluated by the formula.

DateTime dateTimeValue = sheet["C1"].FormulaDateTime;



//Returns number value evaluated by the formula.

double doubleValue = sheet["C1"].FormulaNumberValue;



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();         
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight vbnet %}



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic)



'Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)

## Defined Names 

Named Ranges is a powerful feature in Excel that makes it possible to assign a name to a group of cells. XlsIO has APIs for inserting new named ranges into workbooks and also to read existing named ranges. Named Ranges are mainly used in formulas. It enables better readability, predict at a glance what it is and what is added up with the meaningful range names. 

To create Named Ranges in MS Excel, open Formulas tab and click Define Name button under Defined Names section. Names are created at workbook-level, by default, but you can create a sheet-level name, by entering the sheet name followed by an exclamation mark (!), followed by the name of the range. For instance, to create a named range TEST on Sheet1, enter the name as 'Sheet1!TEST'.

![](Working-with-Formulas_images/Working-with-Formulas_img3.png)



![](Working-with-Formulas_images/Working-with-Formulas_img4.png)



You can create named ranges in spreadsheets through XlsIO with the IName interface. Range for the name is specified through RefersToRange property from where you can access the Range text and other information. This can be specified for workbooks and worksheets. 

###Accessing a Named Range

The following code example illustrates how to create workbook-level named ranges and use it in formulas.

{% highlight C# %}



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



// The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.

IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



// Defines the Range and uses it in the Formula.

IName name1 = workbook.Names.Add("One");

name1.RefersToRange = sheet.Range["A1"];



IName name2 = workbook.Names.Add("Two");

name2.RefersToRange = sheet.Range["B1"];



//Formula by using Defined Names.

sheet.Range["C1"].Formula = "=SUM(One,Two)";



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



//Reads workbook-level named ranges.

for (int i = 0; i <= workbook.Names.Count; i++)

{

    Console.WriteLine(workbook.Names[i].Name.ToString());

    Console.WriteLine(workbook.Names[i].RefersToRange.Address.ToString());

    Console.WriteLine(workbook.Names[i].Value.ToString());

}

## Formula Auditing

Excel has an option to find the quickest way to identify any cell that contains an error on the active worksheet and ignore the error that shows with green indicator through the Error Checking dialog box. This dialog box provides various options to get information on the error, how a formula is evaluated, its trace, and an option to ignore the error by changing its data type.

![](Working-with-Formulas_images/Working-with-Formulas_img6.png)



Excel has the following set of rules that can be enabled or disabled to show/hide warnings with green indicators.

* Evaluates to Error Value-This rule treats cells containing formulas that result in an error and displays a warning.
* Text Date-This rule treats formulas that contain text formatted cells with years represented in 2-digits as an error and displays a warning while checking for errors.
* Number stored as Text-This rule treats numbers formatted as text or preceded by an apostrophe as an error, and displays a warning.
* Inconsistent Formula in Region-This rule treats a formula in a region worksheet that differs from the other formulas in the same region as an error and displays a warning.

## Calculate Options 

This section explains various options that enables customizations of the formula calculations according to the need. It also demonstrates how XlsIO can be linked with Essential Calculate that acts as an Excel engine to calculate Formula values.

Excel has a range of options that allows you to control the way it calculates. To do this, open Tools menu, select Options, and click Calculation tab in the Options dialog box. By default, when one value is changed, the other cell that depends on this immediately changes. This behavior can be changed by using the following Modes of Calculations.

* Automatic
* Automatic except for Data Tables
* Manual



![](Working-with-Formulas_images/Working-with-Formulas_img8.png)



##Automatic Calculation

In the Automatic Calculation mode, Excel automatically recalculates all open workbooks at each and every change and also whenever you open a workbook. Usually when you open a workbook in Automatic mode and recalculate, you cannot be able to see the recalculation because the changes are not reflected until the workbook is saved. An exception is raised when you open a workbook in Excel 2000 that is saved by using Excel 97 or open a workbook by using Excel 2002/2003 saved by using Excel 2000. This is because Excel's calculation engines are different and also because a Full calculation is done.

###Automatic Except Tables

Excel's Data Tables feature is designed to perform multiple calculations of the workbook, each driven by different values in the table. So using Automatic except Tables stop Excel from automatically triggering multiple calculations at each calculation, but still calculates all dependent formulae except tables.

###Manual Calculation

In the Manual Calculation mode, Excel only recalculates all open workbooks when you request it by pressing F9 or CTRL-ALT-F9, or when you Save a workbook. For workbooks taking more than a fraction of a second to recalculate, it is usually better to set the Calculation to Manual. Excel tells you when the workbook needs recalculation by showing Calculate in the status bar.   

XlsIO provides support for all the above modes of calculation. The following code example illustrates how to set the calculation mode.

{% highlight C# %}



// Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();



// Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;



// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel).

// The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2);



IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];



workbook.CalculationOptions.CalculationMode = ExcelCalculationMode.Manual;



string fileName = "Output.xlsx";

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;



workbook.SaveAs(fileName);



// Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();         

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}



' Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.

Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine



' Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel



' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].

'The new workbook will have 2 worksheets.

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(2)



'Accesses via index.

Dim sheet As IWorkbook = workbook.Worksheets(0)



workbook.CalculationOptions.CalculationMode = ExcelCalculationMode.Manual



Dim fileName As String = "Output.xlsx"

workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010



workbook.SaveAs(fileName)



'Closes the workbook.

workbook.Close()

excelEngine.Dispose()

{% endhighlight %}

There are other options that Excel provides to customize the calculation further.

###Recalculate Before Save

In Manual mode, this option controls whether Excel recalculates the workbook as part of the Save process. The default value is set to True. You can control this through XlsIO by using the RecalcOnSave property of ICalculationOptions interface.

###Iteration

When you have intentional circular references in your workbook, these settings allow you to control the maximum number of times the workbook is recalculated (iterations), and the convergence criteria (maximum change: when to stop). The default value should be set to False so that Excel does not try to solve accidental circular references. XlsIO allows control of these iterations as follows.

#### Calculation Engine

Essential XlsIO has a calculation engine of its own and can compute the values of the formula entered during runtime. Essential Calculate is now [from v9.1.x.x] integrated with Essential XlsIO, and thus makes it possible to get the values of the formula entered by using XlsIO during runtime without any additional references or packages. Currently, there are over 180+ functions that are supported by this Calculate engine covering all common usage scenarios.

Sample Link

To understand this process, consider the sample project:
