//Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.
ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();

//Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.
IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;
 
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic);
 
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
 
//Gets the chart from the charts collection.
IChart chart = sheet.Charts[0];

//Gets the first series from the Series collection.
IChartSerie serieOne = chart.Series[0];       

//Sets the Series name to the Data Labels through Data Points.
serieOne.DataPoints[0].DataLabels.IsSeriesName = true;

//Sets the Value to the Data Labels through Data Points.
serieOne.DataPoints[0].DataLabels.IsValue = true;

string fileName = "Output.xlsx";
workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;
 
workbook.SaveAs(fileName);
 
//Closes the workbook.
workbook.Close();
excelEngine.Dispose();
