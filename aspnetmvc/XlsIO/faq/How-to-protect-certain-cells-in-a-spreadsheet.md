# How to protect certain cells in a spreadsheet

All the cells in an Excel spreadsheet have a Locked property that determines if the cell is editable when the worksheet is protected. All the cells are set to Locked, by default. So, when a worksheet is protected, all the cells in the worksheet get protected, by default. However, there is often a need to protect only certain cells in a worksheet. In this scenario, you need to protect a worksheet and set the IsLocked property to false for the cells that need to be made editable.

//Step 1: Instantiates the spreadsheet creation engine.
ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();

//Step 2: Instantiates the excel application object.
IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;
 
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic);
 
IWorksheet sheetOne = workbook.Worksheets[0];
 
// Sample data.
sheetOne.Range["A1:K20"].Text = "Locked";
 
// A1:A10 will not be protected.
sheetOne.Range["A1:A10"].CellStyle.Locked = false;
sheetOne.Range["A1:A10"].Text = "UnLocked";
sheetOne.Protect("syncfusion", ExcelSheetProtection.FormattingColumns);
 
string fileName = "Output.xlsx";
workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;
 
workbook.SaveAs(fileName);
 
// Closes the workbook.
workbook.Close();
excelEngine.Dispose();
