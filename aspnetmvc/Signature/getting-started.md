## Creating your first Signature in MVC application

Create an MVC Project and add necessary assemblies, scripts and CSS files given in [MVC-Getting Started](http://help.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/getting-started) Documentation.

Add Signature control using the helper from EJ namespace.

{% highlight razor %}

  @Html.EJ().Signature("mySign").Height("400px")

## Adjusting Signature Size

We can customize the width and height of the Signature by width and height properties. These properties completely depend on signature canvas. The width and height are adjusted within the signature canvas.

The following code example is used to render the Signature control with customized width and height.

{% highlight razor %}

  @Html.EJ().Signature("mySign").Height("500px").Width("200px")

{% endhighlight %}

The following screenshot illustrates signature with customized width and height.
