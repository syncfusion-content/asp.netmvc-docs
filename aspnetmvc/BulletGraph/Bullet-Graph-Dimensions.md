# Bullet Graph Dimensions

This section explains you on how to change the dimensions of the **Bullet Graph**. You can change various dimensions and properties of Bullet Graph like `width`, `height`, `quantitative scale length`, `qualitative range size` etc. By default, Bullet Graph uses 595 pixel width and 90 pixel height. You can customize width and height of a Bullet Graph using `Width` and `Height` properties of Bullet Graph respectively.

## Size
{% highlight js %}

@(Html.EJ().BulletGraph("Bullets").Width(500).Height(100))

{% endhighlight %}

In the above code example, width is set as 500 pixel and height is set as 100 pixel. The output of the above code example with dimension 500 * 100 is as follows.

## Value for performance bar

The feature measure bar `value` is customized using the Value property. Default value of this property is 0. 
{% highlight js %}

@(Html.EJ().BulletGraph("Bullets").Value(5))

{% endhighlight %}

The following screenshot displays **Bullet Graph** with a performance measure value of 5

## Comparative measure value

The **Comparative measure value** is set using `ComparativeMeasureValue` property. The default value of this property is 0. 
{% highlight js %}

@(Html.EJ().BulletGraph("Bullets").ComparativeMeasureValue(5))

{% endhighlight %}


The following screenshot displays **Bullet Graph** with comparative measure value of 5

                                      .Height(550).FlowDirection(FlowDirection.Backward))

{% endhighlight %}


## Flow direction

The Flow direction of Bullet Graph is customized using `FlowDirection` property. Default value of this property is Forward. Setting Forward renders Bullet Graph left to right and Backward renders from right to left.


{% highlight js %}

@(Html.EJ().BulletGraph("Bullets").ComparativeMeasureValue(2).FlowDirection(FlowDirection.Backward))

{% endhighlight %}

The following screenshot displays **Bullet Graph** in a backward direction.
