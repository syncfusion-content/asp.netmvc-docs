## Bullet Graph Dimensions

This section explains you on how to change the dimensions of the Bullet Graph. You can change various dimensions and properties of Bullet Graph like width, height, quantitative scale length, qualitative range size etc. By default, Bullet Graph uses 595 pixel width and 90 pixel height. You can customize width and height of a Bullet Graph using Width and Height properties of Bullet Graph respectively.

Size

[MVC]



@(Html.EJ().BulletGraph("Bullets").Width(500).Height(100))



In the above code example, width is set as 500 pixel and height is set as 100 pixel. The output of the above code example with dimension 500 * 100 is as follows.

Orientation

Bullet Graph is oriented either horizontally or vertically using Orientation property. Default value of this property is Horizontal. 

[MVC]



@(Html.EJ().BulletGraph("Bullets").Orientation(Orientation.Vertical)

                                      .Width(100)

                                      .Height(550).FlowDirection(FlowDirection.Backward))

Flow direction

The Flow direction of Bullet Graph is customized using FlowDirection property. Default value of this property is Forward. Setting Forward renders Bullet Graph left to right and Backward renders from right to left.



[MVC]



@(Html.EJ().BulletGraph("Bullets").ComparativeMeasureValue(2).FlowDirection(FlowDirection.Backward))



The following screenshot displays Bullet Graph in a backward direction.
