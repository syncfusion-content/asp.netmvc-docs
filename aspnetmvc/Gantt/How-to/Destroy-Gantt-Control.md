# Destroy Gantt Control
Gantt control is composed with more sub-controls like TreeGrid, Splitter, Dialog etc. So while destroying the Gantt control we need to
remove all sub-control elements and unbind all events bound by this control. By using [`destroy`](/api/js/ejgantt#methods:destroy "destroy") public method, we can properly remove the Gantt control from DOM.

The following code example explains how to destroy Gantt control.

{% highlight CSHTML %}

@(Html.EJ().Gantt("gantt")    
    //..
    )
@(Html.EJ().ScriptManager())

<script type="text/javascript">  
$("#gantt").ejGantt("destroy");
<script>
{% endhighlight %}

N> If you want to re-initialize Gantt control on same `div` element,
we need to perform destroy action before re-initialize the Gantt.
