# RTL Support

CurrencyTextBox provides RTL (Right-To-Left) support. The alignment of CurrencyTextBox can be changed from Left-To-Right into Right-To-Left.

## Enable RTL

In the View page add CurrencyTextBox helper, and configure the EnableRTL property.

{% highlight CSHTML %}

@Html.EJ().CurrencyTextbox("currency").Value("33").EnableRTL(true)

{% endhighlight %}



Output of CurrencyTextBox when EnableRTL is “true” is as follows.
