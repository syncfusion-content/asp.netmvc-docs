# Custom Action Support

The Dialog provides custom action buttons such as close, collapsible, maximize, minimize and pin. You can set the action buttons as per your requirement in the Dialog.

## Configure Custom Action

The following steps explains you the implementation of custom action. 

1. In the VIEW page set a helper element with dialog content for rendering the Dialog control. 

   ~~~ js


		// In the CSHTML page add the Dialog widget using helpers and assign the ActionButtons value. 



		@{List<string> icon = new List<string>() { "close", "collapsible", "maximize", "minimize", "pin" };}



		@{Html.EJ().Dialog("customaction").Title("Audi-R8").ContentTemplate(@<div>

		   <img src="@Url.Content("~/Content/images/r8-coupe.png")" />

			   The Audi R8 was initially equipped with a 4.2 litre V8 engine. Specifically, it is an all-aluminum alloy 32-valve (four valves per cylinder) petrol engine, utilising Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), and has a displacement of 4,163 cubic centimetres (254.0 cu in).</div>).Width(300).ActionButtons(icon).Render();}
