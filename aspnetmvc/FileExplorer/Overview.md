# FileExplorer

FileExplorer provides a Windows Explorer-like functionality for any web application. It allows end-users to browse, select and upload files or change the folder structure by renaming, moving and deleting files or folders. File and folder management capabilities are fully customizable and can be disabled when necessary.
