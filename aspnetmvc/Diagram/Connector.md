# Connector

Connectors are objects used to create a link between two nodes. A connector is a line that has connection points at the ends of the line and stays connected to the elements that you attach it to.

_Connector_

##Create Connector

Connector is created from JSON data and added to the Diagram model by using Diagram Model’s Connectors property. The connector’s name must be unique. 

By default, the connector type is straight.

The following code illustrates how to create a Connector and add it to Diagram.



{% highlight c# %}





//Creates a connector

Connector connector = new Connector();

connector.Name = "Connector";

connector.SourcePoint = new DiagramPoint(300,40);

connector.TargetPoint = new DiagramPoint(400, 250);

connector.LineWidth=2;

model.Connectors.Push(connector);



{% endhighlight %}

_Connector_

## Segments

The connector has three types of segments.

* Orthogonal Segments
* Straight Segments
* Bezier Segments

###Orthogonal Segments

Orthogonal segments are visually represented based on the specified length and direction values. 

The following code example illustrates how to add a Connector with an OrthogonalSegment.



{% highlight c# %}


 

//Creates a connector with orthogonal line segment

Connector connector = new Connector();

connector.Name = "Connector";

connector.Segments = new Collection();



//Creates orthogonal segment 

Segment segment = new Segment();

segment.Type= Segments.Orthogonal;

//Adds segments 

connector.Segments.Add(segment);

connector.SourcePoint = new DiagramPoint(300, 40);

connector.TargetPoint = new DiagramPoint(400, 250);

connector.LineWidth = 2;

model.Connectors.Push(connector);



{% endhighlight %}



{{ '![](Connector_images/Connector_img3.png)' | markdownify }}



_Orthogonal Segment_

The following code illustrates how to customize Orthogonal Segment.



{% highlight c# %}
 


//Creates a connector with orthogonal line segment

Connector connector = new Connector();

connector.Name = "Connector";

connector.Segments = new Collection();



//Creates orthogonal segment 

Segment segment = new Segment();

segment.Type= Segments. Orthogonal;



//Length and Direction for orthogonal segment

segment.Length = 90;

segment.Direction = "bottom";



//Adds segments 

connector.Segments.Add(segment);

connector.SourcePoint = new DiagramPoint(300,40);

connector.TargetPoint = new DiagramPoint(400, 250);

connector.LineWidth=2;

model.Connectors.Push(connector);



{% endhighlight %}



![](Connector_images/Connector_img4.png)



_Orthogonal Segment_

###Straight Segment

The straight segments can be added by specifying points as to where the line has to be drawn. The segment end point links the SourcePoint and TargetPoint of the connector. 

The following code example illustrates how to add straight segment through code.

{% highlight c# %}






//Creates a connector with control points

Connector connector = new Connector();

connector.Name = "Connector";

//Creates straight segment 

connector.Segments = new Collection();

Segment segment1 = new Segment();

segment1.Type= Segments. Straight;

//Adds Points for segments

Segment1.Point = new DiagramPoint(400,150);

Segment segment2 = new Segment();

Segment2.Type= Segments. Straight;

Segment2.Point = new DiagramPoint(300,10);

//Adds segments 

connector.Segments.Add(segment1);

connector.Segments.Add(segment2);



connector.SourcePoint = new DiagramPoint(350,200);

connector.TargetPoint = new DiagramPoint(200, 50);

model.Connectors.Push(connector);



{% endhighlight %}

_Polyline_

![](Connector_images/Connector_img6.png)



_Single Line_

The control points can be added or deleted at runtime with shortcut key combination ctrl + shift +click on the control point.

##Bezier Segment

Bezier segments can be added through points or vector.

* Points (point1, point2) are absolute and are specified based on the origin of the page.
* Vectors (vector1, vector2) are relative and are specified based on the length and angle between end points and control points.

The following code example illustrates how to add Bezier segments.



{% highlight c# %}






//Creates a connector with bezier line segment

Connector connector = new Connector();

connector.Name = "Connector";

//Creates Bezier segment 

connector.Segments = new Collection();

Segment segment1 = new Segment();

segment1.Type= Segments.Bezier;

//Adds control points for segments

segment1.Point1 = new DiagramPoint(40,80);

segment1.Point2 = new DiagramPoint(40,72);



//Addssegments 

connector.Segments.Add(segment1);



connector.SourcePoint = new DiagramPoint(350,200);

connector.TargetPoint = new DiagramPoint(200, 50);

model.Connectors.Push(connector);



{% endhighlight %}



![](Connector_images/Connector_img7.png)



_Bezier Segments_

The following code example illustrates how to add vector point to Bezier segments.



{% highlight c# %}


 

//Creates a connector with bezier line segment

Connector connector = new Connector();

connector.Name = "Connector";

//Creates bezier segment 

connector.Segments = new Collection();

Segment segment1 = new Segment();

segment1.Type= Segments.Bezier;

//Adds Vector Points for segments

segment1.Vector1 = new DiagramPoint(180,120);

segment1.Vector2 = new DiagramPoint(10, 140);

//Adds segments 

connector.Segments.Add(segment1);

connector.SourcePoint = new DiagramPoint(310,180);

connector.TargetPoint = new DiagramPoint(190,40);

model.Connectors.Push(connector);



{% endhighlight %}



![](Connector_images/Connector_img8.png)



_Bezier segment with vectors_

##Editing Segments

The segments can be edited during runtime by dragging control thumbs. Segments can be updated when neighboring segments are adjusted.



![](Connector_images/Connector_img9.png)



_Segment Editing_ 

## Connector Padding

Connector Padding allows you to adjust the space between connector’s end point and the object where it is connected (Node, Group, or Port). 

Endpoint adjustment specific to connector ends

Padding distance between source or target end with its connected end (Node, Group, or Port) can be adjusted by using SourcePadding and TargetPadding, respectively.

The following code example illustrates how to adjust the distance by using padding property.



{% highlight c# %}




Connector connector = new Connector();

connector.SourcePadding = 15;

connector.TargetPadding = 20;



{% endhighlight %}



{{ '![](Connector_images/Connector_img10.png)' | markdownify }}



Endpoint adjustment specific to nodes

ConnectorPadding property of a node is used to specify the amount of space needed in pixels between a node and all its connected edges.

The following code examples illustrate how to pad edges connected to a node.

{% highlight c# %}




Node node = new Node();

node.ConnectorPadding = 20;



{% endhighlight %}



![](Connector_images/Connector_img11.png)



Endpoint adjustment specific to ports

ConnectorPadding property of a port is used to specify the amount of space needed in pixels between a port and all its connected edges.

The following code examples illustrate how to pad edges connected to a port.

{% highlight c# %}




//Sets Padding for a port.

Port port = new Port();

port.ConnectorPadding = 20;



{% endhighlight %}



![](Connector_images/Connector_img12.png)



## Line Bridging

Line Bridging creates a bridge for lines to smartly cross over other lines, at points of intersection. When two line connectors meet each other, the line with the higher z-order draws an arc over the line with lower z-order.

Only straight and orthogonal connectors support line bridging.

Line bridging is disabled, by default. You can enable it by adding ConnectorConstraints.Bridging in constraints.

The following code illustrates how to enable line bridging.



{% highlight c# %}




//Enables Line Bridging for a single connector

Connector connector = new Connector();

connector.Constraints = ConnectorConstraints.Default | ConnectorConstraints.Bridging;

//Enables Line Bridging for all connectors added to Diagram model

DiagramContent.Constraints = DiagramConstraints.Default | DiagramConstraints.Bridging;



{% endhighlight %}



![](Connector_images/Connector_img13.png)



_Line Bridging_

When the connector constraint is set as ConnectorConstraints.InheritBridging, bridging is based on DiagramConstraints.

Line Bridging Direction

Direction of the Line Bridge can be customized by using the BridgeDirection property. This property decides the intersecting segment that shows a bridge based on your preferred direction. 

The default value for the Diagram model’s BridgeDirection property is BridgeDirection.Top.

_BridgeDirection Property_
{% highlight html %}
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Properties</td><td>
Description</td><td>
Value</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
BridgeDirection</td><td>
Gets or sets the BridgeDirection for horizontal and vertical lines.</td><td>
EnumBridgeDirection.LeftBridgeDirection.RightBridgeDirection.TopBridgeDirection.Bottom</td></tr>
</table>
{% endhighlight %}
The following code example is used to set Bridge Direction.



Example 1: Bridge for Horizontal Connector with BridgeDirection as Top.


{% highlight c# %}





DiagramProperties model = new DiagramProperties();

//Sets the Bridge Direction

model.BridgeDirection = BridgeDirection.Top;



{% endhighlight %}



![](Connector_images/Connector_img14.png)



_BridgeDirection.Top_



Example 2: Bridge for Vertical Connector with BridgeDirection as Left.


{% highlight c# %}






DiagramProperties model = new DiagramProperties();

//Sets the Bridge Direction

model.BridgeDirection = BridgeDirection.Left;



{% endhighlight %}



![](Connector_images/Connector_img15.png)



_BridgeDirection.Left_



The following API method is used to change the BridgeDirection at runtime.



{% highlight js %}

var diagram = $("#diagram").ejDiagram("instance");

//Updates the Bridge Direction at runtime.

diagram.update({ bridgeDirection: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.BridgeDirection.Top });



{% endhighlight %}

## Corner Radius

CornerRadius support enables you to create connectors with rounded corners. 

The following code example illustrates how to set corner radius for connectors.



{% highlight c# %}




//For node creation refer the link Node Creation

//For Creating connection refer to the link Connecting nodes

//Adds corner radius for connector

Connector connector = new Connector();

Connector.CornerRadius=20;



{% endhighlight %}



![](Connector_images/Connector_img16.png)



_Corner Radius_

##Connecting Nodes

Connector is connected to the bounds of the node and at a specific point on the node.You are required to assign the source node name to connector’s SourceNode property and target node name to connector’s TargetNode property, in order to establish the connection. The port to port connection between specific points on node is established by assigning the name of the node’s port to connector’s TargetPort /SourcePort. At runtime, you can change the point of connection while dragging or rotating node.



{% highlight c# %}




//for node creation refer to the link [Node creation](http://help.syncfusion.com/ug/js/documents/createyourfirstdiagr.htm)

//Creates a connection between headNode/tailNode using connector

Connector connector = new Connector();

connector.SourceNode = "headNode"; //Sets name of sourceNode

connector.TargetNode = "tailNode"; //Sets name of targetNode



{% endhighlight %}



![http://help.syncfusion.com/ug/js/ImagesExt/image59_22.jpg](Connector_images/Connector_img17.jpeg)



_Node to Node Connection_

The point of connection is changed optimally at runtime while performing operations such as Rotating and Dragging on Source/Target Node of Connector. In case of static or specific point connection at runtime, the Port assists to maintain specific point connection between Nodes.

## Connecting Ports

Port establishes the connection with nodes at a specific point.

For creating specific port connection, refer to the link [Port to Port Connection.](http://help.syncfusion.com/ug/js/default.htm)

## Appearance

You can customize the appearance of the connector by setting a desired value to the appropriate appearance properties. The following code illustrates how to customize the appearance of connector.

_Appearance_

connector.SourcePoint = new DiagramPoint(10, 10);

connector.TargetPoint = new DiagramPoint(70, 40);



{% endhighlight %}

##  Decorator

You can decorate the source point and target point of the connector by using decorator shape. The SourceDecorator and TargetDecorator properties are used to add decorators to connector.The following code illustrates how decorator is created and added at connector’s target point.



{% highlight c# %}






//Sets TargetDecorator and SourceDecorator

Connector connector = new Connector();

connector.Name = "Connector";

connector.TargetDecorator = new Decorator();

connector.TargetDecorator.Shape = DecoratorShapes.Arrow;

connector.TargetDecorator.Width = 10;

connector.TargetDecorator.Height = 10;

connector.SourceDecorator.Shape = DecoratorShapes.Circle;

connector.SourceDecorator.Width = 10;

connector.SourceDecorator.Height = 10;



{% endhighlight %}

##Decorator Appearance

Decorator appearance is customized by setting the desired value to the appropriate appearance properties.

_Decorator Appearance_
{% highlight html %}
<table>
<tr>
<td>

connector.TargetDecorator.Shape = DecoratorShapes.Arrow;

connector.TargetDecorator.Width = 8;

connector.TargetDecorator.Height = 8;

connector.TargetDecorator.BorderColor = "black";

connector.SourceDecorator.Shape = DecoratorShapes.Circle;

connector.SourceDecorator.Width = 8;

connector.SourceDecorator.Height = 8;

connector.SourceDecorator.FillColor = "yellow";



{% endhighlight %}
