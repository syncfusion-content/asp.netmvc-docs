# Predefined Shapes

## In-built Shapes

Diagram has several in-built shapes .The in-built shapes are categorized as follows.

1. Basic Shapes
2. Flow Shapes
3. BPMN shapes

### Basic Shape

The Basic shapes are common shapes used to represent geometrical information visually.

The following code example illustrates how to create a basic shape.

{% highlight c# %}




//Creates a basic shape

BasicShape node = new BasicShape();

node.Shape = BasicShapes.Plus;



{% endhighlight %}



 The list of basic shapes are as follows.

### Flow Shape

The flow shapes are used to represent the process flow. It is used for analysing, designing, managing, or for documentation process. 

The following code example illustrates how to create a flow shape. 

{% highlight c# %}



//Creates a flow shape

FlowShape node = new FlowShape();

node.Shape = FlowShapes.Document;



{% endhighlight %}



The list of flow shapes are as follows.

### BPMN Shape

BPMN shapes are used to represent internal business procedure in graphical notation and enables you to communicate the procedures in a standard manner.

The BPMN shapesare categorized as follows.

1. Event
2. Gateway
3. Activity
4. Message
5. DataSource
6. DataObject

The shapes are listed as follows.

The BPMN shapes and its types are explained as follows.

#### Event 

An event is represented with a circle and it denotes something that happens. Icons within the circle denote the type of event. For example, an envelope representing a message or a clock representing time. 

The following code example illustrates how to create an event in BPMN shape.

{% highlight c# %}
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   


//Creates an event shape in BPMN 

BPMNNode node = new BPMNNode();

node.Shapes = BPMNShapes.Event;

node.Event = BPMNEvents.Start;

node.Trigger = BPMNTriggers.None;

{% endhighlight  %}

## Gateway

Gateway is used to control the flow of a process. It is represented as a diamond shape.

There are several types in Gateway. They are listed as follows.

1. None
2. Exclusive
3. Parallel
4. Inclusive
5. Complex
6. Event Based

The following code example illustrates how to create a gateway in BPMN shape.

{% highlight c# %}



//Creates a gateway shape in BPMN 

 BPMNNode node = new BPMNNode();

 node.Shapes = BPMNShapes.Gateway;



{% endhighlight %}

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>

{{ '![](Predefined-Shapes_images/Predefined-Shapes_img22.png)' | markdownify }}

</td></tr>
</table>


## Activity

The activity is the task that is performed in a process. It is represented by rounded rectangle.

There are two types of activities.They are listed as follows.

1. Task - Occurs within a process and it is not broken down to finer level of detail.
2. Subprocess - Occurs within a process broken down to finer level of detail.

_Activity Type_

The following code example illustrates how to create activity in BPMN shape.

{% highlight c# %}



//Creates an activity shape in BPMN

 BPMNNode node = new BPMNNode();

 node.Shapes = BPMNShapes.Activity;

 node.Activity = BPMNActivity.Task;



{% endhighlight %}



The different activities in the BPMN shape are listed as follows.

1. Loop

   The task that is internally looped.

   ![](Predefined-Shapes_images/Predefined-Shapes_img23.png)



2. Tasks

   The task for sending, receiving, user based task, etc

   ![](Predefined-Shapes_images/Predefined-Shapes_img24.png)



3. Compensation

   Compensation is triggered when operation partially fails.

   ![](Predefined-Shapes_images/Predefined-Shapes_img25.png)



4. Call

   ![](Predefined-Shapes_images/Predefined-Shapes_img26.png)



5. Ad-Hoc

   ![](Predefined-Shapes_images/Predefined-Shapes_img27.png)



6. Boundary

   Boundary represents the type of task that is processed.

## Data

Data object is used to represent the data produced by activities in process.

DataSource is used to read and write data.

### DataObject & Datasource

The following code example illustrates how to create connecting objects in BPMN shape.

{% highlight c# %}



//Creates a DataObject shape in BPMN

BPMNNode node = new BPMNNode();

node.Shapes = BPMNShapes.DataObject;

//Creates a DataSource shape in BPMN

BPMNNode node = new BPMNNode();

node.Shapes = BPMNShapes.DataSource;



{% endhighlight %}
