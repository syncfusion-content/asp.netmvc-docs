# Interaction

## Tool

There are many interactive features on Diagram surface. A collection of predefined tools are available in Diagram.

_Tool_

<table>
<tr>
<th>
Tool name</th><th>
Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
panTool </td><td>
Allows you to pan the diagram</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
move </td><td>
Allows you to move the selected Node/Connector.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Select</td><td>
Allows you to select the diagram node/connector objects.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
textTool</td><td>
Allows you to add new text or edit an existing text</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
endPointTool</td><td>
Allow you to drag connector’s end point </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
resizeTool</td><td>
Allow you to resize the nodes </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
rotateTool</td><td>
Allow you to rotate nodes</td></tr>
</table>


The following code illustrates how to activate and deactivate the desired tool.



{% highlight js %}



//Activates pan tool

var diagram = $("#Diagram").ejDiagram("instance");

diagram.activateTool("panTool");



//Deactivates current tool

diagram.deactivateTool();



{% endhighlight %}

## Selection

Selection feature allows you to select single or multiple Nodes/Connectors.

* Single selection
* Multiple selection

### Single selection

The Nodes/Connectors on Diagram surface is selected when the Select constraint is enabled. Selection is done through the following two ways. 

* Mouse Click
* addSelection method.

#### Mouse Click

The node/connector is selected by clicking a desired node/connector.

####addSelection method

Diagram provides public API addSelection for adding node/connector to the selection.
The following code illustrates how to add node/connector to selection.

{% highlight js %}



var node = diagram.model.nodes[0];

//Adds node to selection

diagram.addSelection(node);



{% endhighlight %}

### Multiple Selections

Multiple selections are done by using rubber band selection, Ctrl + Click and Ctrl + A.  During Multipleselections, the selector binds all the selected items.

### Rubber band Selection

Rubber band selection is done by clicking and dragging mouse pointer on the Diagram canvas and rectangle helper appears during Rubber band selection. The Diagram Nodes/Connectors that intersect in the selection rectangle bounds are added to the selection list.

var DeleteTool = (function (base) {

ej.datavisualization.Diagram.extends(DeleteTool, base);

function DeleteTool(name) {

base.call(this, name);

this.singleAction = true;

}


//mouse down for delete tool

DeleteTool.prototype.mousedown = function (evt) {

base.prototype.mousedown.call(this, evt);

this.inAction = true;

this.selectedObject = this.diagram.selectionList[0];

};



//mouse move for delete tool

DeleteTool.prototype.mousemove = function (evt) { 

base.prototype.mousemove.call(this, evt);

};


//mouse up for delete tool

DeleteTool.prototype.mouseup = function (evt) {

var diagram = $(“#diagram”).ejDiagram(“instance”);

if (this.inAction) 
 {

   this.inAction = false;

   diagram.remove(this.selectedObject);
 }

 base.prototype.mouseup.call(this, evt);

};

return DeleteTool;

})

## Zoom 

The Diagram is zoomed in and out. Zooming is achieved in the following ways.

* Using the zoom commands.
* Using the mouse wheel.

## MouseWheel

Press the CTRL key and roll the mouse wheel up to zoom in or down to zoom out.

## Zoom Factor

Diagram allows you to set the ZoomFactor where you can zoom in or out. This factor can be specified by using the ZoomFactor property. The default value is 0.2.



{% highlight c# %}

diagram.Model.ZoomFactor = 0.2; 



{% endhighlight %}

* Drag and Drop from the SymbolPalette.
* Dragging the Node and Line Connector on drawing area.
* Panning.
* Multiple selection.
* Contextmenu (touch and hold).
* Text Editing (double tap).

## Snapping


Snapping feature handles snapping operation with gridlines and Nodes/Connectors

* SnapToGrid
* SnapToObject

### SnapToGrid

The snap-to-grid feature allows Diagram objects to snap the nearest intersection of gridlines when being dragged or resized. This feature enables easier alignment during layout or design. 

The SnapToGrid feature is enabled by using a snapSetting’s SnapConstraints property.

_SnapToGrid_

<table>
<tr>
<th>
Properties</th><th>
Data Type</th><th>
Descriptions</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
HorizontalGridLines</td><td>
Object</td><td>
Gets or sets the horizontal gridlines </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
VerticalGridLines</td><td>
Object</td><td>
Gets or sets the vertical gridlines</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
EnableSnapToObject</td><td>
Boolean</td><td>
Gets or sets whether snapping to object is enabled or not</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
SnapAngle</td><td>
Int</td><td>
Gets or sets the snap angle</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
SnapConstraints</td><td>
SnapConstraints</td><td>
Gets or sets whether snapping to gridlines option is enabled or not</td></tr>
</table>


## Enable snapping 

Snapping to gridlines is enabled or disabled by changing the value of snap Setting’s SnapConstraints as SnapConstraints.



{% highlight c# %}



//Enables snap to horizontal gridlines constraint

model.SnapSettings.SnapConstraints = SnapConstraints.SnapToHorizontalLines;

//Enables snap to vertical gridlines constraint

model.SnapSettings.SnapConstraints = SnapConstraints.SnapToVerticalLines;

//Snaps to both Horizontal and Vertical gridlines

model.SnapSettings.SnapConstraints = SnapConstraints.SnapToLines;



{% endhighlight %}

### SnapInterval

You can customize the position where a Diagram object snaps by changing the value of the SnapInterval property of grid lines.

SnapInterval is a double collection that determines the space between patterns of gridlines.



{% highlight c# %}




//Sets snap interval

List<decimal> interval = new List<decimal>();

interval.Add(20);

model.SnapSettings.HorizontalGridlines.SnapInterval = interval;



{% endhighlight %}

### SnapToObject

The snap-to-object feature provides visual cues to assist with aligning and spacing diagram nodes. You can snap a node with its neighboring objects based on its size and position. Such alignments are visually represented as guidelines.



![](Interaction_images/Interaction_img4.png)



Enabling and Disabling snapping to objects

SnapSettings.EnableSnapToObject determines whether nodes are snapped to object or not.

{% highlight c# %}




//Enables snap to object behavior

model.SnapSettings.EnableSnapToObject = true;



{% endhighlight %}

### SnapAngle

You can rotate the Node with multiples of SnapAngle.

{% highlight c# %}




//Sets snap angle

model.SnapSettings.SnapAngle = 5;



{% endhighlight %}
