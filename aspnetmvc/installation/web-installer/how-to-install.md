# Installing Syncfusion ASP.NET MVC web installer


## Overview

For the Essential Studio ASP.NET MVC product, Syncfusion offers a Web Installer. This installer alleviates the burden of downloading a larger installer. You can simply download and run the online installer, which will be smaller in size and will download and install the Essential Studio products you have chosen. You can get the most recent version of Essential Studio Web Installer [here](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/login). 

 
## Installation

The steps below show how to install Essential Studio ASP.NET MVC Web Installer.

1.  Open the Syncfusion Essential Studio ASP.NET MVC Web Installer file from downloaded location by double-clicking it. The Installer Wizard automatically opens and extracts the package.
